GO:0019748	NA	BP	secondary metabolic process	"The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in many of the chemical changes of compounds that are not necessarily required for growth and maintenance of cells, and are often unique to a taxon. In multicellular organisms secondary metabolism is generally carried out in specific cell types, and may be useful for the organism as a whole. In unicellular organisms, secondary metabolism is often used for the production of antibiotics or for the utilization and acquisition of unusual nutrients." [GOC:go_curators]

GO:0030154	NA	BP	cell differentiation	"The process in which relatively unspecialized cells, e.g. embryonic or regenerative cells, acquire specialized structural and/or functional features that characterize the cells, tissues, or organs of the mature organism or some other relatively stable phase of the organism's life history. Differentiation includes the processes involved in commitment of a cell to a specific fate and its subsequent development to the mature state." [ISBN:0198506732]

GO:0030246	GO:0005529	MF	carbohydrate binding	"Interacting selectively and non-covalently with any carbohydrate, which includes monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides as well as substances derived from monosaccharides by reduction of the carbonyl group (alditols), by oxidation of one or more hydroxy groups to afford the corresponding aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, or by replacement of one or more hydroxy group(s) by a hydrogen atom. Cyclitols are generally not regarded as carbohydrates." [CHEBI:16646, GOC:mah]
GO:0030312	NA	CC	external encapsulating structure	"A structure that lies outside the plasma membrane and surrounds the entire cell or cells. This does not include the periplasmic space." [GOC:go_curators]
GO:0031012	GO:0005578	CC	extracellular matrix	"A structure lying external to one or more cells, which provides structural support, biochemical or biomechanical cues for cells or tissues." [GOC:BHF, GOC:mah, GOC:rph, NIF_Subcellular:nlx_subcell_20090513, PMID:21123617, PMID:28089324]

GO:0140110	NA	MF	transcription regulator activity	"A molecular function that controls the rate, timing and/or magnitude of transcription of genetic information. The function of transcriptional regulators is to modulate gene expression at the transcription step so that they are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism."
