IPR006118	Recombinase, conserved site	interpro7_conserved-site	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination plays an important role in DNA rearrangement in prokaryotic organisms. Two types of site-specific recombination are known to occur:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between inverted repeats resulting in the reversal of a DNA segment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between repeat sequences on two DNA molecules resulting in their cointegration, or between repeats on one DNA molecule resulting in the excision of a DNA fragment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination is characterised by a strand exchange mechanism that requires no DNA synthesis or high energy cofactor; the phosphodiester bond energy is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage and re-ligation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Two unrelated families of recombinases are currently known [[cite:PUB00001148]]. The first, called the 'phage integrase' family, groups a number of bacterial, phage and yeast plasmid enzymes. The second [[cite:PUB00003786]], called the 'resolvase' family, groups enzymes which share the following structural characteristics: an N-terminal catalytic and dimerization domain that contains a conserved serine residue involved in the transient covalent attachment to DNA, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The resolvase family is currently known to include the following proteins:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;DNA invertase from Salmonella typhimurium  (gene hin). Hin can invert a 900 bp DNA fragment adjacent to a gene for one of the flagellar antigens.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;DNA invertase from Escherichia coli (gene pin).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;DNA invertase from Bacteriophage Mu (gene gin), P1 and P7 (gene cin).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Resolvases from transposons Tn3, Tn21, Tn501, Tn552, Tn917, Tn1546, Tn1721, Tn2501 and Tn1000 (known as gamma-delta resolvase).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Resolvase from Clostridium perfringens plasmid pIP404.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Resolvase from  E. coli plasmid R46.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Resolvase from E. coli plasmid RP4 (gene parA).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;A putative recombinase from Bacillus subtilis (gene cisA) [[cite:PUB00002098]] which plays an important role in sporulation by catalyzing the recombination of genes spoIIIC and spoIVCB to form polymerase sigma-K factor.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Uvp1, a protein from E. coli plasmid pR which cooperates with the mucAB genes in the DNA repair process and could be a resolvase [[cite:PUB00003732]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, proteins from the resolvase family have 180 to 200 amino-acid residues, excepting cisA which is much larger (500 residues).&lt;/p&gt;
IPR018892	Retro-transposon transporting motif	interpro7_conserved-site	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This is the highly conserved motif GRKIxxxxxRRKx of nucleoporins that plays a critical and unique role in the nuclear import of retro-transposons in both yeasts and higher organisms. It would appear that the arginine residues at positions 2 and 9-10 constitute a bipartite nuclear localisation signal, with two basic peptide motifs separated by an interchangeable spacer sequence, that is crucial for the retro-transposon activity [[cite:PUB00044409]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR000071	Immunodeficiency lentiviral matrix, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Retroviral matrix proteins (or major core proteins) are components of envelope-associated capsids, which line the inner surface of virus envelopes and are associated with viral membranes [[cite:PUB00014063]]. Matrix proteins are produced as part of Gag precursor polyproteins. During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved into major structural proteins by the viral protease, yielding the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and some smaller peptides. Gag-derived proteins govern the entire assembly and release of the virus particles, with matrix proteins playing key roles in Gag stability, capsid assembly, transport and budding. Although matrix proteins from different retroviruses appear to perform similar functions and can have similar structural folds which predominantly consist of four closely packed alpha-helices that are interconnected through loops, their primary sequences can be very different [[cite:PUB00055853]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents matrix proteins from immunodeficiency lentiviruses, such as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV-cpz) [[cite:PUB00016321]]. The structure of the HIV protein consists of 5 alpha helices, a short 3.10 helix and a 3-stranded mixed beta-sheet [[cite:PUB00003338]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000081	Peptidase C3, picornavirus core protein 2A	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain defines cysteine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family C3 (picornain, clan PA(C)), subfamilies 3CA and 3CB. The protein fold of this peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of the serine peptidase, chymotrypsin [[cite:PUB00004181]], the type example for clan PA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Picornaviral proteins are expressed as a single polyprotein\r\nwhich is cleaved by the viral 3C cysteine protease [[cite:PUB00003174]]. The poliovirus polyprotein is selectively cleaved between the Gln-|-Gly bond. In other picornavirus reactions Glu may be substituted for Gln, and Ser or Thr for Gly.\r\n&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.  Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring.  In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base.  Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan.  Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases.  From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families [[cite:PUB00011704]].  Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole.  Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases.  They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloromercuribenzoate.&lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold.  There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp).  A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a beta-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these.  Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases [[cite:PUB00076953]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold.  Proteins in the clan have an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys.  The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues [[cite:PUB00020025]]. Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a beta barrell.  The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys.  This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold.  Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides.  The fold shows a closed beta barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel [[cite:PUB00030423]].  The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000199	Peptidase C3A/C3B, picornaviral	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry includes cysteine peptidases that belong to MEROPS peptidase family C3 (picornain, clan PA(C)), subfamilies C3A and C3B. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viruses in the order Picornavirales infect different vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant hosts and are responsible for a variety of human, animal, and plant diseases. These viruses have a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome that generally translates a large precursor polyprotein which is proteolytically cleaved after translation to generate mature functional viral proteins. This process is usually mediated by (more than one) proteases, and a 3C (for the family Picornaviridae) or 3C-like (3CL) protease (for other families) plays a central role in the cleavage of the viral precursor polyprotein. In addition to this key role, 3C/3C-like protease is able to cleave a number of host proteins to remodel the cellular environment for virus reproduction [[cite:PUB00032759], [cite:PUB00094816], [cite:PUB00050441], [cite:PUB00056357], [cite:PUB00056400], [cite:PUB00094817]]. The Picornavirales 3C/3C-like protease domain forms the MEROPS peptidase family C3 (picornain family) of clan PA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3C/3CL protease domain adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold with a cysteine nucleophile in place of a commonly found serine which suggests that the cysteine and serine perform an analogous catalytic function. The catalytic triad is made of a histidine, an aspartate/glutamate and the conserved cysteine in this sequential order. The 3C/3CL protease domain folds into two antiparallel beta barrels that are linked by a loop with a short alpha-helix in its middle, and flanked by two other alpha-helices at the N- and C-terminal. The two barrels are topologically equivalent and are formed by six antiparallel beta strands with the first four organised into a Greek key motif. The active-site residues are located in the cleft between the two barrels with the nucleophilic Cys from the C-terminal barrel and the general acid base His-Glu/Asp from the N-terminal barrel [[cite:PUB00032759], [cite:PUB00094816], [cite:PUB00056357]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000208	RNA-directed RNA polymerase, flavivirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) ([intenz:2.7.7.48]) is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage [[cite:PUB00033622], [cite:PUB00033623]]. It catalyses synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear.\r\nThe postulated RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of RNA synthesis begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a primer-independent (de novo) mechanism. The de novo initiation consists in the addition of a nucleotide tri-phosphate (NTP) to the 3'-OH of the first initiating NTP. During the following so-called elongation phase, this nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the complementary RNA product [[cite:PUB00033624]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;All the RNA-directed RNA polymerases, and many DNA-directed polymerases, employ a fold whose organisation has been likened to the shape of a right hand with three subdomains termed fingers, palm and thumb [[cite:PUB00030617]]. Only the catalytic palm subdomain, composed of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with two alpha-helices, is well conserved among all of these enzymes. In RdRp, the palm subdomain comprises three well conserved motifs (A, B and C). Motif A (D-x(4,5)-D) and motif C (GDD) are spatially juxtaposed; the Asp residues of these motifs are implied in the binding of Mg2+ and/or Mn2+. The Asn residue of motif B is involved in selection of ribonucleoside triphosphates over dNTPs and thus determines whether RNA is synthesised rather than DNA [[cite:PUB00033625]].\r\nThe domain organisation [[cite:PUB00009392]] and the 3D structure of the catalytic centre of a wide range of RdPp's, even those with a low overall sequence homology, are conserved. The catalytic centre is formed by several motifs containing a number of conserved amino acid residues.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are 4 superfamilies of viruses that cover all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage:&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Viruses containing positive-strand RNA or double-strand RNA, except retroviruses and Birnaviridae: viral RNA-directed RNA polymerases including all positive-strand RNA viruses with no DNA stage, double-strand RNA viruses, and the Cystoviridae, Reoviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, Totiviridae families.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Mononegavirales (negative-strand RNA viruses with non-segmented genomes).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes, i.e. Orthomyxoviruses (including influenza A, B, and C viruses, Thogotoviruses, and the infectious salmon anemia virus), Arenaviruses, Bunyaviruses, Hantaviruses, Nairoviruses, Phleboviruses, Tenuiviruses and Tospoviruses.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Birnaviridae family of dsRNA viruses.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\nThe RNA-directed RNA polymerases in the first of the above superfamilies can be divided into the following three subgroups:&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;All positive-strand RNA eukaryotic viruses with no DNA stage.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;All RNA-containing bacteriophages -there are two families of RNA-containing bacteriophages: Leviviridae (positive ssRNA phages) and Cystoviridae (dsRNA phages).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Reoviridae family of dsRNA viruses.&lt;/li&gt; \r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flaviviruses produce a polyprotein from the ssRNA genome. The polyprotein is cleaved to a number of products one of which is NS5. Recombinant dengue type 1 virus NS5 protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. This RNA-directed RNA polymerase possesses a number of short regions and motifs homologous to other RNA-directed RNA polymerases [[cite:PUB00005614]]. NS5 binds to a the stem loop A (SLA) at the 5' extremity of Flavivirus genome and regulates translation of the viral genome [[cite:PUB00095857], [cite:PUB00098521]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000280	Pestivirus NS3, peptidase S31	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The genome of pestiviruses is a single plus-strand RNA and contains a\r\nsingle large open reading frame (ORF), a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and a\r\n3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The ORF encodes a polyprotein, which is\r\nprocessed by viral and cellular proteases into mature proteins (the structural\r\nproteins in the N-terminal portion of the polyprotein whilst the replicative\r\n(non-structural or NS) proteins constitute the remainder).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The pestivirus NS3\r\nprotein is a multifunctional protein possessing serine protease, RNA helicase, and a nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activities\r\nlocated in two functionally distinct domains. The N-terminal one-third of\r\npestiviral NS3 primarily serves as a protease to process the viral\r\npolyprotein. The helicase and NTPase activities are localized to the C-\r\nterminal of NS3 protein [[cite:PUB00057971], [cite:PUB00020058],  [cite:PUB00057972]]. The NS3 protease domain has approximately 180 aa\r\nwith a catalytic triad of His-Asp-Ser. Positive regulation (activation) is\r\nobserved by its interaction with NS4A. The pestivirus NS3 proteolytic domain constitutes MEROPS peptidase family S31 of clan PA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the pestivirus NS3 protease domain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.

IPR000317	Peptidase C24, Calicivirus polyprotein Orf1	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The two signatures that defines this group of calivirus polyproteins identify a cysteine peptidase signature that belongs to MEROPS peptidase family C24 (clan PA(C)).  \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Caliciviruses are positive-stranded ssRNA viruses that cause gastroenteritis. The calicivirus genome contains two open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2. ORF2 encodes a structural protein [[cite:PUB00003528]]; while \r\nORF1 encodes a non-structural polypeptide, which has RNA helicase, cysteine\r\nprotease and RNA polymerase activity. The regions of the polyprotein in\r\nwhich these activities lie are similar to proteins produced by the picornaviruses. Two different families of caliciviruses can be distinguished on the basis of sequence similarity, namely those classified as small round structured viruses (SRSVs) and those classed as non-SRSVs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Calicivirus proteases from the non-SRSV group, which are members of the PA\r\nprotease clan, constitute family C24 of the cysteine proteases (proteases\r\nfrom SRSVs belong to the C37 family). As mentioned above, the protease\r\nactivity resides within a polyprotein. The enzyme cleaves the polyprotein\r\nat sites N-terminal to itself, liberating the polyprotein helicase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.

IPR000382	Peptidase S39B, luteovirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;ORF2 of Potato leafroll virus (PLrV) encodes a polyprotein which is translated following a -1 frameshift. The polyprotein has a putative linear arrangement of membrane achor-VPg-peptidase-polmerase domains. The serine peptidase domain which is found in this group of sequences belongs to MEROPS peptidase family S39 (clan PA(S)). It is likely that the peptidase domain is involved in the cleavage of the polyprotein [[cite:PUB00011866]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The nucleotide sequence for the RNA of PLrV has been determined [[cite:PUB00003126], [cite:PUB00001567]]. The sequence contains six large open reading frames (ORFs). The 5' coding region encodes two polypeptides of 28K and 70K, which overlap in different reading frames; it is suggested that the third ORF in the 5' block is translated by frameshift readthrough near the end of the 70K protein, yielding a 118K polypeptide [[cite:PUB00003126]]. Segments of the predicted amino acid sequences of these ORFs resemble those of known viral RNA polymerases, ATP-binding proteins and viral genome-linked proteins. The nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) has been determined [[cite:PUB00004354]]. The sequence contains six long ORFs. A cluster of three of these ORFs, including the coat protein cistron, display extensive amino acid sequence similarity to corresponding ORFs of a second luteovirus: Barley yellow dwarf virus [[cite:PUB00004354]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000404	Flavivirus non-structural protein NS4A	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Flaviviruses encode a single polyprotein.  This is cleaved into\r\nthree structural and seven non-structural proteins. The NS4A\r\nprotein is small and poorly conserved among the Flaviviruses.\r\nNS4A contains multiple hydrophobic potential membrane spanning\r\nregions [[cite:PUB00000118]].  NS4A has only been found in cells infected by Kunjin virus [[cite:PUB00005567]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000477	Reverse transcriptase domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The use of an RNA template to produce DNA, for integration into the host  genome and exploitation of a host cell, is a strategy employed in the replication of retroid elements, such as the retroviruses and bacterial retrons. The enzyme catalysing polymerisation is an RNA-directed DNA-polymerase, or reverse trancriptase (RT) ([intenz:2.7.7.49]). Reverse transcriptase occurs in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns [[cite:PUB00070025]], bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Retroviral reverse transcriptase is synthesised as part of the POL polyprotein that contains; an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. The discovery of retroelements in the prokaryotes raises intriguing questions concerning their roles in bacteria and the origin and evolution of reverse transcriptases and whether the bacterial reverse transcriptases are older than eukaryotic reverse transcriptases [[cite:PUB00006358]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several crystal structures of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain have been determined [[cite:PUB00012846]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000487	Flavivirus non-structural protein NS2B	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic members of the flavivirus family [E1], including West Nile Virus\r\n(WNV) and Dengue Virus (DV), are growing global threats for which there are no\r\nspecific treatments. The genome encodes three structural proteins found in\r\nthe mature virion (C, prM, and E) and seven \"nonstructural\" (i.e., not part of\r\nthe virion architecture) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).\r\nFull-length NS3 is a bifunctional protein. The N-terminal 175 residues\r\ncomprise a chymotrypsin-like protease, \"NS3pro\", while the C-terminal portion\r\nis a helicase (\"NS3hel\"). The NS2B protein, which is located in the\r\npolypeptide precursor immediately upstream of the NS3pro domain, functions as\r\nthe cofactor for NS3pro. A 35-48 residue central portion is required for\r\nprotease activity in vitro, while N- and C-terminal flanking hydrophobic\r\nregions are predicted to anchor the NS2B-NS3 complex into the host endoplasmic\r\nreticulum membrane. The two component flaviviral enzyme NS2B-NS3 cleaves the\r\nviral polyprotein precursor within the host cell, a process that is required\r\nfor viral replication [[cite:PUB00041729], [cite:PUB00057952], [cite:PUB00057953]]. The NS3pro domain forms peptidase family S7\r\n(flavivirin family) of clan PA [E2].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NS3pro has a classical serine protease catalytic triad (His, Asp, and\r\nSer). The enzymatic activity of NS3pro is enhanced by interacting with the\r\ncentral 40 amino acid of NS2B which acts as an essential cofactor. The NS3pro\r\ndomain has an overall structure of two barrels made of six beta sheets each,\r\nwith the active site located in the cleft between the barrels. The NS2B\r\nhydrophilic core cofactor contributes one of the N-terminal beta sheets [[cite:PUB00041729], [cite:PUB00057952], [cite:PUB00057953]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain cover the entire flavivirus NS2B and NS3pro domains.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000588	Peptidase A3A, cauliflower mosaic virus-type	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Aspartic peptidases, also known as aspartyl proteases ([intenz:3.4.23.-]), are widely distributed proteolytic enzymes [[cite:PUB00001330], [cite:PUB00000093], [cite:PUB00000349]] known to exist in vertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, retroviruses and some plant viruses. All known aspartic peptidases are endopeptidases.  A water molecule, activated by two aspartic acid residues, acts as the nucleophile in catalysis.  Aspartic peptidases can be grouped into five clans, each of which shows a unique structural fold [[cite:PUB00000522]].\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peptidases in clan AA are either bilobed (family A1 or the pepsin family) or are a homodimer (all other families in the clan, including retropepsin from HIV-1/AIDS) [[cite:PUB00042504]].  Each lobe consists of a single domain with a closed beta-barrel and each lobe contributes one Asp to form the active site.  Most peptidases in the clan are inhibited by the naturally occurring small-molecule inhibitor pepstatin [[cite:PUB00076784]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AC contains the single family A8: the signal peptidase 2 family.  Members of the family are found in all bacteria.  Signal peptidase 2 processes the premurein precursor, removing the signal peptide.  The peptidase has four transmembrane domains and the active site is on the periplasmic side of the cell membrane.  Cleavage occurs on the amino side of a cysteine where the thiol group has been substituted by a diacylglyceryl group.  Site-directed mutagenesis has identified two essential aspartic acid residues which occur in the motifs GNXXDRX and FNXAD (where X is a hydrophobic residue) [[cite:PUB00076785]].  No tertiary structures have been solved for any member of the family, but because of the intramembrane location, the structure is assumed not to be pepsin-like.&lt;/li&gt; \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AD contains two families of transmembrane endopeptidases: A22 and A24.  These are also known as \"GXGD peptidases\" because of a common GXGD motif which includes one of the pair of catalytic aspartic acid residues.  Structures are known for members of both families and show a unique, common fold with up to nine transmembrane regions [[cite:PUB00066803]].  The active site aspartic acids are located within a large cavity in the membrane into which water can gain access [[cite:PUB00065205]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AE contains two families, A25 and A31.  Tertiary structures have been solved for members of both families and show a common fold consisting of an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich, in which the beta sheet is five stranded [[cite:PUB00011023], [cite:PUB00021296]].&lt;/li&gt;  \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AF contains the single family A26.  Members of the clan are membrane-proteins with a unique fold.  Homologues are known only from bacteria.  The structure of omptin (also known as OmpT) shows a cylindrical barrel containing ten beta strands inserted in the membrane with the active site residues on the outer surface [[cite:PUB00011707]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;There are two families of aspartic peptidases for which neither structure nor active site residues are known and these are not assigned to clans.   Family A5 includes thermopsin, an endopeptidase found only in thermophilic archaea.  Family A36 contains sporulation factor SpoIIGA, which is known to process and activate sigma factor E, one of the transcription factors that controls sporulation in bacteria [[cite:PUB00076786]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This aspartic peptidase domain is found in viral enzymatic polyproteins. It belongs to MEROPS peptidase family A3, subfamily A3A (cauliflower mosaic virus-type endopeptidase, clan AA). \r\n\r\n\r\nCauliflower mosaic virus belongs to the Retro-transcribing viruses, which have a \r\ndouble-stranded DNA genome. The genome includes an open reading frame (ORF V) that shows similarities to the pol\r\ngene of retroviruses. This ORF codes for a polyprotein that includes a reverse transcriptase, which, on the basis\r\nof a DTG triplet near the N terminus, was suggested to include an aspartic protease. The presence of an aspartic\r\nprotease has been confirmed by mutational studies, implicating Asp-45 in catalysis. The protease releases itself\r\nfrom the polyprotein and is involved in reactions required to process the ORF IV polyprotein, which includes the\r\nviral coat protein [[cite:PUB00003578]]. The viral aspartic peptidase domain has also been found associated with a  polyprotein encoded by integrated pararetrovirus-like sequences in the genome of Nicotiana tabacum (Common tobacco) [[cite:PUB00011867]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR000721	Retroviral nucleocapsid  Gag protein p24, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Gag protein from retroviruses, also known as p24, forms the inner protein layer of the nucleocapsid. It is composed of two domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD), which contributes to viral core formation, and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which is required for capsid dimerisation, Gag oligomerization and viral formation [[cite:PUB00011708], [cite:PUB00011710]]. This protein performs highly complex orchestrated tasks during the assembly, budding, maturation and infection stages of the viral replication cycle. During viral assembly, the proteins form membrane associations and self-associations that ultimately result in budding of an immature virion from the infected cell. Gag precursors also function during viral assembly to selectively bind and package two plus strands of genomic RNA. ELISA tests for p24 is the most commonly used method to demonstrate virus replication both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; [[cite:PUB00003583], [cite:PUB00098654]].&lt;/p&gt; This is the N-terminal domain of capsid protein p24 from retroviruses.
IPR000840	Gamma-retroviral matrix protein	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Retroviral matrix proteins (or major core proteins) are components of envelope-associated capsids, which line the inner surface of virus envelopes and are associated with viral membranes [[cite:PUB00014063]]. Matrix proteins are produced as part of Gag precursor polyproteins. During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved into major structural proteins by the viral protease, yielding the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and some smaller peptides. Gag-derived proteins govern the entire assembly and release of the virus particles, with matrix proteins playing key roles in Gag stability, capsid assembly, transport and budding. Although matrix proteins from different retroviruses appear to perform similar functions and can have similar structural folds which predominantly consist of four closely packed alpha-helices that are interconnected through loops, their primary sequences can be very different [[cite:PUB00055853]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents matrix proteins from gamma-retroviruses, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), Feline leukemia virus (FLV), and Feline sarcoma virus (FESV) [[cite:PUB00016326], [cite:PUB00016327]]. This entry also identifies matrix proteins from several eukaryotic endogenous retroviruses, which arise when one or more copies of the retroviral genome becomes integrated into the host genome [[cite:PUB00016320]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000930	Peptidase S3, togavirin	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Togavirin, also known as Sindbis virus core endopeptidase, is a serine protease resident at the N terminus of the p130 polyprotein of togaviruses [[cite:PUB00003576]]. The endopeptidase signature identifies the peptidase as belonging to the MEROPS peptidase family S3 (togavirin family, clan PA(S)). The polyprotein also includes structural proteins for the nucleocapsid core and for the glycoprotein spikes [[cite:PUB00003576]]. Togavirin is only active while part of the polyprotein, cleavage at a Trp-Ser bond resulting in total lack of activity [[cite:PUB00003576]]. Mutagenesis studies have identified the location of the His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad, and X-ray studies have revealed the protein fold to be similar to that of chymotrypsin [[cite:PUB00003576], [cite:PUB00004110]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001037	Integrase, C-terminal, retroviral	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Integrase comprises three domains capable of folding independently and whose three-dimensional structures are known. However, the manner in which the N-terminal, catalytic core, and C-terminal domains interact in the holoenzyme remains obscure. Numerous studies indicate that the enzyme functions as a multimer, minimally a dimer. The integrase proteins from Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and Avian sarcoma virus (have been studied most carefully with respect to the structural basis of catalysis. Although the active site of avian virus integrase does not undergo significant conformational changes on binding the required metal cofactor, that of HIV-1 does. This active site-mediated conformational change  in HIV-1 reorganises the catalytic core and C-terminal domains and appears to promote an interaction that is favourable for catalysis [[cite:PUB00006506]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Retroviral integrase is synthesised as part of the POL polyprotein that contains; an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. The presence of retrovirus integrase-related gene sequences in eukaryotes is known. Bacterial transposases involved in the transposition of the insertion sequence also belong to this group. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;HIV-1 integrase catalyses the incorporation of virally derived DNA into the human genome. This unique step in the virus life cycle provides a variety of points for intervention and hence is an attractive target for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of AIDS [[cite:PUB00006492]]. Substrate recognition by the retroviral integrase enzyme is critical for retroviral integration. To catalyse this recombination event, integrase must recognise and act on two types of substrates, viral DNA and host DNA, yet the necessary interactions exhibit markedly different degrees of specificity [[cite:PUB00006507]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001205	RNA-directed RNA polymerase,  C-terminal domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the C-terminal domain of the RNA-directed RNA polymerase found in many positive strand RNA eukaryotic viruses. It is part of the genome polyprotein that contains other polypeptides such as coat proteins VP1 to VP4, core proteins P2A to P2C and P3A, genome-linked protein VPG and picornain 3C ([intenz:3.4.22.28]).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Structural studies indicate that these proteins form the \"right hand\" structure found in all oligonucleotide polymerases, containing thumb, finger and palm domains, and also the additional bridging finger and thumb domains unique to RNA-directed RNA polymerases [[cite:PUB00028057], [cite:PUB00028058], [cite:PUB00094093], [cite:PUB00098221]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001490	Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS4b	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The genome polyprotein contains: caspid protein C, envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, protein P7, nonstructural protein NS2, protease/helicase NS3, nonstructural proteins NS4A and NS4B (this family), NS5A and NS5B.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The small proteins  NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B are hydrophobic, suggesting a possible membrane-related function [[cite:PUB00000745]].\r\nIt is known that NS4B interacts with NS4A and NS3 to form a large\r\nreplicase complex to direct the viral RNA replication [[cite:PUB00003532]].  NS3 and NS5  may also play a role in the viral RNA replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001528	Flavivirus non-structural protein NS4B	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Flaviviruses encode a single polyprotein. This is cleaved into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The NS4B protein is small and poorly conserved among the Flaviviruses. NS4B contains multiple hydrophobic potential membrane spanning regions [[cite:PUB00000118]]. NS4B may form membrane components of the viral replication complex and could be involved in membrane localisation of NS3 and NS5 (see [interpro:IPR000208]) [[cite:PUB00000118]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001584	Integrase, catalytic core	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The retroviral integrase is the enzyme responsible for the insertion of a DNA copy of the viral genome into host DNA, an essential step in the replication cycle of viruses [[cite:PUB00018337]]. Integrases comprise three functional and structural domains: the central core domain, which contains the catalytic residues, an N-terminal zinc finger and a C-terminal DNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00018338]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The integrase catalytic domain catalyses a series of reactions to integrate the viral genome into a host chromosome. In the first step, it removes two 3' end nucleotides from each strand of the linear viral DNA, leaving overhanging CA-OH ends. In the second step, the processed 3' ends are covalently joined to the 5' ends of the target DNA. In the third step, which probably involves additional cellular enzymes, unpaired nucleotides at the viral 5' ends are removed and the ends are joined to the target site 3' ends, generating an integrated provirus flanked by five base-pair direct repeats of the target site DNA [[cite:PUB00018343]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal structure of the catalytic domain shows a dimeric structure, with each monomer containing a five-stranded beta-sheet and six alpha-helices [[cite:PUB00005191]]. This fold is characteristic of the polynucleotidyltransferase superfamily whose members include RNase H, the bacteriophage Mu transposase, and the E. coli Holliday junction resolving enzyme, RuvC [[cite:PUB00016297]]. The catalytic domain of integrase contains the DD35E triad motif. As in other DNA-binding proteins containing this motif, these acidic residues coordinate a divalent Mg2+ in the resting enzyme. Substituting any one of these residues abolishes both processing and integration activities of integrase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The integrase catalytic domain is also found in various transposase proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001641	Spumavirus aspartic protease A9	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Aspartic peptidases, also known as aspartyl proteases ([intenz:3.4.23.-]), are widely distributed proteolytic enzymes [[cite:PUB00001330], [cite:PUB00000093], [cite:PUB00000349]] known to exist in vertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, retroviruses and some plant viruses.

At present, the virus has not been proven to cause any particular disease. However, studies have shown Human foamy virus causes neurological disorders in infected mice [[cite:PUB00004317]]. The virus genome encodes gag and pol genes for polyproteins that are processed by an aspartic endopeptidase that is a component of one of the polyproteins [[cite:PUB00076800], [cite:PUB00076801]].  In the human virus, the aspartic protease is encoded by the gag gene [[cite:PUB00003482]], and in monkeys by the pol gene [[cite:PUB00001804]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The FV aspartic peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family A9 (spumapepsin family, clan AA). The structure has been solved for the peptidase from simian foamy virus and shows a retropepsin-like fold [[cite:PUB00048142]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001665	Norovirus peptidase C37	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Noroviruses (NVs, formerly \"Norwalk-like viruses\"), which belong to the\r\nCaliciviridae, are the major causative agents of nonbacterial acute\r\ngastroenteritis in humans. The NV genome, which consists of positive-sense,\r\nsingle-stranded RNA, contains three open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF\r\nproduces a polyprotein that is processed by the viral 3C-like protease into\r\nsix nonstructural proteins. The six NV ORF1 nonstructural proteins are\r\nhomologous to picornaviral nonstructural proteins and are named accordingly:\r\nN-terminal protein, 2C-like nucleoside triphosphatase, 3A-like protein, 3B VPg\r\n(genome-linked viral protein), 3C-like protease, and a 3D RNA-\r\ndependent RNA polymerase. NV 3C-like proteases are the key enzymes for ORF1 polyprotein\r\nprocessing and also cleave the poly(A)-binding protein, causing cellular\r\ntranslation inhibition. NV 3C-like proteases belong to the chymotrypsin-like protease\r\nfamily, in that they appear to have chymotrypsin-like folds. Whether the\r\n3C-like protease domain has a catalytic dyad of composed of histidine and cysteine or\r\ntryad of histidine, glutamate and cysteine remains controversial [[cite:PUB00046832], [cite:PUB00040868]]. The NV\r\n3C-like protease domain forms MEROPS peptidase family C37.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NV 3C-like protease domain adopts a serine protease-like fold that consists of two\r\nbeta-barrels separated by a cleft within which lie the active site catalytic\r\nresidues. The N-terminal beta barrel has two alpha-helices\r\nand seven beta-strands. The beta-strands form a twisted antiparallel beta-\r\nsheet resembling an incomplete beta-barrel. The core of the incomplete beta-\r\nbarrel contains hydrophobic residues. The active site histidine residue is\r\nfound in the N-terminal beta-barrel, as well as the glutamate. The C-terminal\r\nsix-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel contains the active site cysteine. The\r\ncatalytic site formed is situated deep within a cleft between the N- and C-\r\nterminal beta-barrels [[cite:PUB00046832], [cite:PUB00040868]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.  Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring.  In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base.  Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan.  Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases.  From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families [[cite:PUB00011704]].  Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole.  Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases.  They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloromercuribenzoate.&lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold.  There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp).  A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a beta-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these.  Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases [[cite:PUB00076953]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold.  Proteins in the clan have an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys.  The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues [[cite:PUB00020025]]. Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a beta barrell.  The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys.  This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold.  Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides.  The fold shows a closed beta barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel [[cite:PUB00030423]].  The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001730	Potyvirus NIa protease (NIa-pro) domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Tobacco etch virus (TEV), tomato vein mottling virus (TVMV), and plum pox\r\nvirus (PPV) are members of the Potyviridae family. The potyvirus genome\r\nis a (+) stranded RNA and is translated into a single polyprotein upon\r\ninfection, which is processed by the virally encoded proteases P1, HC-Pro, and\r\nNIa. Most of the cleavage events are performed by NIa (nuclear inclusion\r\nprotein a) protease (NIa-pro). NIa-pro processes seven sites present in the\r\npotyvirus polyprotein, named as A, B, C, D, V, E, and F. NIa-pros obtained\r\nfrom potyviruses have similar structures and functions. The potyvirus NIa-pro\r\nhas a His-Asp-Cys catalytic triad, which is homologous to the trypsin-like\r\nproteases except for Cys replacing Ser. NIa-pros obtained\r\nfrom potyviruses share certain sequence identities; however they recognise\r\ndistinct amino acid sequences at each recognition sites. Consequently, they\r\ncannot recognise the cleavage sites of each other efficiently [[cite:PUB00057996]]. Nia-pro\r\nbelongs to peptidase family C4. In addition to the catalytic activity\r\nNIa-pro possesses also sequence non-specific RNA-binding activity and RNA\r\npolymerase (NIb) binding activity [[cite:PUB00022120]].\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe potyvirus NIa protein contains the following two domains; the VPg domain\r\nat the N terminus and the NIa-pro domain at the C terminus [[cite:PUB00057996], [cite:PUB00057997]]. The ~250-amino acid NIaPro domain adopts the characteristic two-domain antiparallel\r\nbeta-barrel fold that is the hallmark of trypsin-like serine proteases, with\r\nthe catalytic triad residues His, Asp, and Cys located at the interface\r\nbetween domains [[cite:PUB00022120]].\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThis entry represents the NIa-pro domain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.  Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring.  In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base.  Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan.  Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases.

IPR001788	Tymovirus, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents RNA dependent RNA polymerases found in several types of viruses [[cite:PUB00001007]], especially those with a tripartite genome (RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3) and an encapsidated subgenomic RNA (RNA4) from which the coat protein is expressed, such as Cucumber mosaic virus (strain NT9) (CMV). This entry contains the following proteins:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Viral RNA-directed RNA polymerase 2A (protein 2A) [[cite:PUB00035782]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Putative RNA dependent RNA polymerase from Tobacco mosaic virus [[cite:PUB00003525]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Non structural polyprotein from Togavirus [[cite:PUB00003501]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;
IPR001850	Flavivirus NS3, petidase S7	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The viral genome of Flavivirus is a positive strand RNA that encodes a single  polyprotein precursor. Processing of the polyprotein precursor into mature proteins is carried out by the host signal peptidase and by NS3 serine  protease, which requires NS2B ([interpro:IPR000487]) as a cofactor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pathogenic members of the flavivirus family, including West Nile Virus\r\n(WNV) and Dengue Virus (DV), are growing global threats for which there are no\r\nspecific treatments. The genome encodes three structural proteins found in\r\nthe mature virion (C, prM, and E) and seven \"nonstructural\" (i.e., not part of\r\nthe virion architecture) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).\r\nFull-length NS3 is a bifunctional protein. The N-terminal 175 residues\r\ncomprise a chymotrypsin-like protease,  while the C-terminal portion\r\nis a helicase. The NS2B protein, which is located in the\r\npolypeptide precursor immediately upstream of the NS3 protease domain, functions as the cofactor for NS3 protease. A 35-48 residue central portion is required for\r\nprotease activity in vitro, while N- and C-terminal flanking hydrophobic\r\nregions are predicted to anchor the NS2B-NS3 complex into the host endoplasmic\r\nreticulum membrane. The two component flaviviral enzyme NS2B-NS3 cleaves the\r\nviral polyprotein precursor within the host cell, a process that is required\r\nfor viral replication [[cite:PUB00041729], [cite:PUB00057952], [cite:PUB00057953]]. The NS3 protease forms the MEROPS peptidase family S7 (flavivirin family), clan PA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NS3 protease has a classical serine protease catalytic triad (His, Asp, and\r\nSer). The enzymatic activity is enhanced by interacting with the\r\ncentral 40 amino acid of NS2B which acts as an essential cofactor. The NS3 protease\r\ndomain has an overall structure of two barrels made of six beta sheets each,\r\nwith the active site located in the cleft between the barrels. The NS2B\r\nhydrophilic core cofactor contributes one of the N-terminal beta sheets [[cite:PUB00041729], [cite:PUB00057952], [cite:PUB00057953]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001995	Peptidase A2A, retrovirus, catalytic	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Aspartic peptidases, also known as aspartyl proteases ([intenz:3.4.23.-]), are widely distributed proteolytic enzymes [[cite:PUB00001330], [cite:PUB00000093], [cite:PUB00000349]] known to exist in vertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, retroviruses and some plant viruses. All known aspartic peptidases are endopeptidases.  A water molecule, activated by two aspartic acid residues, acts as the nucleophile in catalysis.  Aspartic peptidases can be grouped into five clans, each of which shows a unique structural fold [[cite:PUB00000522]].\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peptidases in clan AA are either bilobed (family A1 or the pepsin family) or are a homodimer (all other families in the clan, including retropepsin from HIV-1/AIDS) [[cite:PUB00042504]].  Each lobe consists of a single domain with a closed beta-barrel and each lobe contributes one Asp to form the active site.  Most peptidases in the clan are inhibited by the naturally occurring small-molecule inhibitor pepstatin [[cite:PUB00076784]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AC contains the single family A8: the signal peptidase 2 family.  Members of the family are found in all bacteria.  Signal peptidase 2 processes the premurein precursor, removing the signal peptide.  The peptidase has four transmembrane domains and the active site is on the periplasmic side of the cell membrane.  Cleavage occurs on the amino side of a cysteine where the thiol group has been substituted by a diacylglyceryl group.  Site-directed mutagenesis has identified two essential aspartic acid residues which occur in the motifs GNXXDRX and FNXAD (where X is a hydrophobic residue) [[cite:PUB00076785]].  No tertiary structures have been solved for any member of the family, but because of the intramembrane location, the structure is assumed not to be pepsin-like.&lt;/li&gt; \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AD contains two families of transmembrane endopeptidases: A22 and A24.  These are also known as \"GXGD peptidases\" because of a common GXGD motif which includes one of the pair of catalytic aspartic acid residues.  Structures are known for members of both families and show a unique, common fold with up to nine transmembrane regions [[cite:PUB00066803]].  The active site aspartic acids are located within a large cavity in the membrane into which water can gain access [[cite:PUB00065205]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AE contains two families, A25 and A31.  Tertiary structures have been solved for members of both families and show a common fold consisting of an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich, in which the beta sheet is five stranded [[cite:PUB00011023], [cite:PUB00021296]].&lt;/li&gt;  \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AF contains the single family A26.  Members of the clan are membrane-proteins with a unique fold.  Homologues are known only from bacteria.  The structure of omptin (also known as OmpT) shows a cylindrical barrel containing ten beta strands inserted in the membrane with the active site residues on the outer surface [[cite:PUB00011707]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;There are two families of aspartic peptidases for which neither structure nor active site residues are known and these are not assigned to clans.   Family A5 includes thermopsin, an endopeptidase found only in thermophilic archaea.  Family A36 contains sporulation factor SpoIIGA, which is known to process and activate sigma factor E, one of the transcription factors that controls sporulation in bacteria [[cite:PUB00076786]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This group of aspartic peptidases belong to the peptidase clan AA.  The clan includes the single domain aspartic proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons, and badnaviruses (plant dsDNA viruses) which are active as homodimers.   While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin [[cite:PUB00000349], [cite:PUB00032703]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A2 includes the peptidase (retropepsin, EC 3.4.23.16) from the human immunodeficiency virus and other retroviruses. In most retroviruses, the peptidase is encoded as a segment of a polyprotein (usually the pol polyprotein, which includes the peptidase, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and an integrase, but occassionally the gag polyprotein) which it cleaves during viral maturation to release individual proteins.  Some retrotransposon polyproteins also contain a homologous, retropepsin-like peptidase which is also a member of family A2.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A3 includes peptidases from the double-stranded DNA plant viruses known as badnaviruses or pararetroviruses. The viral genome includes genes (ORFs IV and V) that encodes polyproteins.  The ORF V polyprotein contains the peptidase and a reverse transcriptase.  The peptidase processes the ORF IV polyprotein, which includes the viral coat protein [[cite:PUB00076788]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A9 includes peptidases from spumaretroviruses, and the peptidase is a component of either the gag and pol polyprotein, which is processes [[cite:PUB00076789]].  The structure has been solved for the peptidase from simian foamy virus and shows a retropepsin-like fold [[cite:PUB00048142]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A11 includes polyprotein-processing peptidases from retrotransposons such as the copia transposon from &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;.  No tertiary structure has been solved for any member of the family, and family A11 is included in clan AA on the basis of the similar motif around the active site  Asp.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A28 includes the yeast DNA-damage inducible protein 1 which is a component of the DNA repair pathway.  The tertiary structure shows a retropepsin-like fold [[cite:PUB00041573]].  This peptidase is not a component of a polyprotein.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A32 includes the bacterial PerP peptidase which converts the transmembrane factor PodJ from a form that recruits proteins for pilus formation, to a truncated form that recruits proteins for stalk formation.  This converts the bacterium from a motile form to the sessile form found in biofilms [[cite:PUB00076754]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002079	Gag polyprotein, inner coat protein p12	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The retroviral p12 protein is a proline rich virion structural protein found in the inner coat. p12 is associated with pathogenicity of the virus [[cite:PUB00003504]]. It is a constituent of the pre-integration complex (PIC) and mediates its integration [[cite:PUB00096937]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002104	Integrase, catalytic domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;P&gt;Phage integrase proteins cleave DNA substrates by a series of staggered cuts, during which the protein becomes covalently linked to the DNA through a catalytic tyrosine residue at the carboxy end of the alignment [[cite:PUB00005224], [cite:PUB00004261]].&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;The catalytic site residues in CRE recombinase ([swissprot:P06956]) are Arg-173, His-289, Arg-292 and Tyr-324.&lt;/P&gt;
IPR002156	Ribonuclease H domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The RNase H domain is responsible for hydrolysis of the RNA portion of RNA x DNA hybrids,  and this activity requires the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+) that bind its active  site. This domain is a part of a large family of homologous RNase H enzymes of which the RNase HI protein from Escherichia coli is the best characterised [[cite:PUB00006422], [cite:PUB00079405], [cite:PUB00025090]]. Secondary structure predictions for the enzymes from E. coli, yeast, human liver and diverse retroviruses (such as Rous sarcoma virus and the Foamy viruses) supported, in every case, the five beta-strands (1 to 5) and four or five alpha-helices (A, B/C, D, E) that have been identified by crystallography in the RNase H domain of Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase and in E. coli RNase H [[cite:PUB00006461]]. Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a modular enzyme carrying polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities in separable domains. Reverse transcriptase (RT) converts the single-stranded RNA genome of a retrovirus into a double-stranded DNA copy for integration into the host genome. This process requires ribonuclease H as well as RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Retroviral RNase H is synthesised as part of the POL polyprotein that contains; an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. Bacterial RNase H [intenz:3.1.26.4] catalyses endonucleolytic cleavage to 5'-phosphomonoester acting on RNA-DNA hybrids. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The  3D structure of the RNase H domain from diverse bacteria and retroviruses has  been  solved [[cite:PUB00015351], [cite:PUB00015352], [cite:PUB00015353], [cite:PUB00042692]]. All have four beta strands  and four to five alpha helices. The E. coli RNase H1 protein binds a single Mg2+ ion cofactor in the  active site of the enzyme. The divalent cation is bound by the carboxyl groups of four acidic residues, Asp-10, Glu-48, Asp-70, and Asp-134 [[cite:PUB00015352]]. The first three acidic residues are highly conserved in all bacterial and retroviral RNase H sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002492	Transposase, Tc1-like	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposase proteins are necessary for efficient DNA transposition. This  helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain is found in the amino-terminal region of Tc1, Tc1A, Tc1B and Tc2B transposases of Caenorhabditis elegans [[cite:PUB00088287]]. The region encompasses the specific DNA binding and second DNA recognition domains as well as an amino-terminal region of the catalytic domain of Tc3 as described in [[cite:PUB00001309]]. Tc3 is a member of the Tc1/mariner family of transposable elements.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002513	Tn3 transposase DDE domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Proteins containing this domain include transposases of Tn3, Tn21, Tn1721, Tn2501, Tn3926 transposons from Escherichia coli. The specific binding of the Tn3 transposase to DNA has been demonstrated. Sequence analysis has suggested that the invariant triad of Asp689, Asp765, Glu895 (numbering as in Tn3) may correspond to the D-D-35-E motif previously implicated in the catalytic performance of numerous transposases [[cite:PUB00000555]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002518	Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS2	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The viral genome is translated into a single polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. Generation of the mature non-structural proteins relies on the activity of viral proteases.  Non-structural protein 2 (NS2) is an zinc-dependent autocatalytic endopeptidase which cleaves at the NS2/NS3 junction [[cite:PUB00000745], [cite:PUB00003531]]. The action of NS3 proteinase (NS3P, [interpro:IPR004109]), which resides in the N-terminal one-third of the NS3 protein, then yields all remaining non-structural proteins. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;NS2 belongs to MEROPS peptidase family C18 (hepatitis C virus endopeptidase 2, clan CM).  The fold consists of two subdomains: an N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal beta sheet.  Peptidases are active as a homodimer and the two active sites are formed at the dimer interface by His and Glu from one monomer and Cys from the other [[cite:PUB00041366]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.  Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring.  In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base.  Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan.  Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases.  From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families [[cite:PUB00011704]].  Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole.  Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases.  They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloromercuribenzoate.&lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold.  There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp).  A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a beta-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these.  Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases [[cite:PUB00076953]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold.  Proteins in the clan have an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys.  The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues [[cite:PUB00020025]]. Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a beta barrell.  The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys.  This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold.  Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides.  The fold shows a closed beta barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel [[cite:PUB00030423]].  The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002521	Hepatitis C virus core protein, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The HCV core protein is located at the N terminus of the polyprotein and is followed by the signal sequence located between the core protein and the E1 envelope glycoprotein. This signal sequence targets the nascent HCV polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), allowing the translocation of E1 to the ER lumen. Cleavage by a signal peptidase in the ER lumen releases the N-terminal end of E1, leaving the 191-amino acids (aa) core protein anchored by its C-terminal signal peptide [[cite:PUB00020019], [cite:PUB00053353]]. This 191aa polypeptide, also known as p23, is the immature form of the core protein; p23 is further processed by an intramembrane protease, the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), that removes the ER anchor , releasing  p21, the N-terminal 179aa mature form of the core protein  [[cite:PUB00020019]].  Core protein (p21) is responsible for packaging viral RNA to form a viral nucleocapsid, and it also promotes virion budding [[cite:PUB00053354]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Two domains have been identified in the mature form of the HCV core protein, based on predicted structural and functional characteristics [[cite:PUB00053355]]. Domain I, corresponding to the N-terminal  region of approximately 120 aa, is a highly basic domain that is probably involved in the recruitment of viral RNA during particle morphogenesis. Domain II, located between aa 120 and aa 175, is a hydrophobic region predicted to form one or two alpha-helices that are probably involved in the association of core with the ER membrane and lipid droplets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small (50 nm in size), enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus. It is the only known member of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. There are six major genotypes of the hepatitis C virus, which are identified numerically (e.g., genotype 1, genotype 2, etc.). Although Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C virus have similar names, because they all cause liver inflammation, these are distinctly different viruses both genetically and clinically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HCV has a positive sense RNA genome that consists of a single open reading frame of 9600 nucleotides.  At the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA are the UTR regions that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5' UTR has a ribosome binding site (IRES - Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a 3000 amino acid containing protein that is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into 10 active structural and non-structural smaller proteins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents domain II and domain III (ER anchor sequence) of the core protein p23. &lt;/p&gt;

IPR002532	Hantavirus glycoprotein G2	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The medium (M) genome segment of Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) encodes the two virion glycoproteins [[cite:PUB00004342]], G1 and G2, as a polyprotein precursor. This entry represents the polyprotein region which forms the G2 glycoprotein. It has been shown that the N-terminal region of envelope glycoprotein G2 has the conserved CNP motif, suggested to be an integrin-binding motif [[cite:PUB00094390]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR002535	Flavivirus polyprotein propeptide	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Flaviviruses are small enveloped animal viruses containing a single positive strand genomic RNA [[cite:PUB00000118]].  The genome encodes one large ORF, a polyprotein which undergos proteolytic cleavage of the precursor membrane protein (prM), turning inert virus into infectious particles. This entry consists of a propeptide region of approximately 90 amino acids in length [[cite:PUB00050900]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002540	Peptidase S30, polyprotein P1, potyvirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Proteolytic enzymes that exploit serine in their catalytic activity are ubiquitous, being found in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00003576]]. They include a wide range of peptidase activity, including exopeptidase, endopeptidase, oligopeptidase and omega-peptidase activity. Many families of serine protease have been identified, these being grouped into clans on the basis of structural similarity and other functional evidence [[cite:PUB00003576]]. Structures are known for members of the clans and the structures indicate that some appear to be totally unrelated, suggesting different evolutionary origins for the serine peptidases [[cite:PUB00003576]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Not withstanding their different evolutionary origins, there are similarities in the reaction mechanisms of several peptidases. Chymotrypsin, subtilisin and carboxypeptidase C have a catalytic triad of serine, aspartate and histidine in common: serine acts as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base [[cite:PUB00003576]]. The geometric orientations of the catalytic residues are similar between families, despite different protein folds [[cite:PUB00003576]]. The linear arrangements of the catalytic residues commonly reflect clan relationships. For example the catalytic triad in the chymotrypsin clan (PA) is ordered HDS, but is ordered DHS in the subtilisin clan (SB) and SDH in the carboxypeptidase clan (SC) [[cite:PUB00003576], [cite:PUB00000522]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The potyviridae are a family of positive strand RNA viruses, members of which include Zucchini yellow mosaic virus, and Turnip mosaic virus (strain Japanese) which cause considerable losses of crops worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a C-terminal region from various plant potyvirus P1 proteins (found at the N terminus of the polyprotein). The C terminus of P1 is a serine peptidase belonging to MEROPS peptidase family S30 (clan PA(S)). It is the protease responsible for autocatalytic cleavage between P1 and the helper component protease, which is a cysteine peptidase belonging to MEROPS peptidase family C6 [interpro:IPR001456] [[cite:PUB00003163], [cite:PUB00005588]]. The P1 protein may be involved in virus-host interactions [[cite:PUB00003163]], and evasion of immune responses [[cite:PUB00097802]].&lt;/p&gt;

Transposases have been grouped into various families [[cite:PUB00004452], [cite:PUB00003820], [cite:PUB00001812]]. This family includes the IS4 transposase.&lt;/p&gt;

IPR002620	Alphavirus nsp2 protease (nsp2pro) domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The family of alphaviruses includes 26 known members. They infect a variety of hosts including mosquitoes, birds, rodents and other mammals with worldwide\r\ndistribution. Alphaviruses also pose a potential threat to human health in\r\nmany area. For example, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) causes\r\nencephalitis in humans as well as livestock in Central and South America, and\r\nsome variants of Sinbis Virus (SIN) and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) have been\r\nfound to cause fever and arthritis in humans [[cite:PUB00055516]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alphaviruses possess a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 kb.  The genomic RNA of alphaviruses is translated into two polyproteins that,\r\nrespectively, encode structural proteins and nonstructural proteins. The\r\nnonstructural proteins may be translated as one or two polyproteins, nsp123 or\r\nnsp1234, depending on the virus. These polyproteins are cleaved to generate\r\nnsp1, nsp2, nsp3 and nsp4 by a protease activity that resides within nsp2. The\r\nnsp2 protein of alphaviruses has multiple enzymatic acivities. Its N-terminal\r\ndomain has been shown to possess ATPase and GTPase activity, RNA helicase\r\nactivity and RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity. The C-terminal nsp2pro domain of\r\nnsp2 is responsible for the regulation of 26S subgenome RNA synthesis,\r\nswitching between negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis, targeting nsp2\r\nfor nuclear transport and proteolytic processing of the nonstructural\r\npolyprotein [[cite:PUB00055516], [cite:PUB00041527]]. The nsp2pro domain is a member of peptidase family C9 of clan CA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The nsp2pro domain consists of two distinct subdomains. The\r\nnsp2pro N-terminal subdomain is largely alpha-helical and contains the\r\ncatalytic dyad cysteine and histidine residues organised in a protein fold\r\nthat differs significantly from any known cysteine protease or protein folds.\r\nThe nsp2pro C-terminal subdomain displays structural similarity to S-adenosyl-\r\nL-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferases and provides essential elements\r\nthat contribute to substrate recognition and may also regulate the structure\r\nof the substrate binding cleft [[cite:PUB00041527]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This domain covers the entire nsp2pro domain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.  Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring.  In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base.  Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan.  Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases.  From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families [[cite:PUB00011704]].  Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole.  Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases.  They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloromercuribenzoate.&lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold.  There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp).  A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a beta-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these.  Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases [[cite:PUB00076953]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold.  Proteins in the clan have an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys.  The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues [[cite:PUB00020025]]. Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a beta barrell.  The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys.  This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold.  Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides.  The fold shows a closed beta barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel [[cite:PUB00030423]].  The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002686	Transposase IS200-like	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposases are needed for efficient transposition of the insertion sequence or transposon DNA. This entry represents a domain found in transposases for IS200 from Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00034636]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002705	Peptidase C30/C16,  Betacoronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found in betacoronavirus cysteine endopeptidases that belong to MEROPS peptidase families C30 (clan PA) and C16 (subfamiles C16A and C16B, clan CA). These peptidase are involved in viral polyprotein processing. All coronaviruses encodes between one and two accessory cysteine proteinases that recognise and process one or two sites in the amino-terminal half of the replicase polyprotein during assembly of the viral replication complex. MHV, HCoV and TGEV encode two accesssory proteinases, called coronavirus papain-like proteinase 1 and 2 (PL1-PRO and PL2-PRO). IBV and SARS encodes only one called PL-PRO [[cite:PUB00011622]]. Coronavirus papain-like proteinases 1 and 2 have restricted specificities, cleaving respectively two and one bond(s)in the polyprotein. This restricted activity may be due to extended specificity sites: Arg or Lys at the cleavage site position P5 are required for PL1-PRO [[cite:PUB00017034]], and Phe at the cleavage site position P6 is required for PL2-PRO [[cite:PUB00017035]]. PL1-PRO releases p28 and p65 from the N terminus of the polyprotein; PL2-PRO cleaves between p210 and p150. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.

IPR003036	Core shell protein Gag P30	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; Gag polyprotein plays a role in budding and is processed by the viral protease during virion maturation outside the cell [[cite:PUB00066869]]. It can be cleaved into 4 chains: matrix protein p15, RNA-binding phosphoprotein p12, capsid protein p30 and nucleocapsid protein p10. This entry represents the capsid protein p30. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Capsid protein p30 forms the spherical core of the virion that encapsulates the genomic RNA-nucleocapsid complex [[cite:PUB00066869]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR003139	Delta-retroviral matrix protein	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Retroviral matrix proteins (or major core proteins) are components of envelope-associated capsids, which line the inner surface of virus envelopes and are associated with viral membranes [[cite:PUB00014063]]. Matrix proteins are produced as part of Gag precursor polyproteins. During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved into major structural proteins by the viral protease, yielding the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and some smaller peptides. Gag-derived proteins govern the entire assembly and release of the virus particles, with matrix proteins playing key roles in Gag stability, capsid assembly, transport and budding. Although matrix proteins from different retroviruses appear to perform similar functions and can have similar structural folds which predominantly consist of four closely packed alpha-helices that are interconnected through loops, their primary sequences can be very different [[cite:PUB00055853]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents matrix proteins from delta-retroviruses such as Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 and Human T-cell leukemia virus 2 (HTLV-2), both members of the human oncovirus subclass of retroviruses [[cite:PUB00016315], [cite:PUB00016314]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR003308	Integrase, N-terminal zinc-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Retroviral integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains: an N-terminal zinc binding domain, a central catalytic core and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00026646], [cite:PUB00024383]]. Often found as part of the POL polyprotein.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR003314	Mu-type HTH domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposons are mobile genetic elements that move from one DNA site to another\r\nwithin their host's genome, often with profound biological consequences. The\r\nMu genome is the largest and most efficient transposon known. The Mu\r\ntransposase (MuA) is a multidomain protein, which is responsible for\r\ntranslocation of the Mu genome. Mu transposase can be divided into three\r\nstructurally distinct domains, each with specific functions. The amino-\r\nterminal domain (30kDa) is responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding and\r\ncan further be subdivided into two separate subdomains, which bind an internal\r\nactivation sequence (IAS) and the ends of the phage genome, respectively. A\r\nhighly homologous IAS binding domain is also present in the Mu repressor\r\nprotein (MuR), but its binding promotes lysogeny of the phage by repressing\r\nthe expression of genes required for lytic growth and by directly blocking MuA\r\naccess to the IAS. The IAS binding domains of the MuR and MuA proteins are\r\nDNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domains of about 75 residues (Mu-\r\ntype HTH) [[cite:PUB00031519], [cite:PUB00028537]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Mu-type HTH domain consists of a three-membered alpha-helical bundle\r\nbuttressed by a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with an overall B1-H1-\r\nT-H2-B2-W-B3-H3 topology (where B,H,T and W stand for beta-strand, alpha-\r\nhelix, turn and wing, repectively. Helices H1 and H2 and the\r\nseven-residue turn connecting them comprise a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif.\r\nWhile the general appearance of the Mu-type DNA-binding domain is similar to\r\nthat of other winged HTH proteins, the connectivity of the secondary structure\r\nelements is permuted. Hence this fold represents a novel class of winged HTH\r\nDNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00031519], [cite:PUB00028537]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR003322	Beta-retroviral matrix protein	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Retroviral matrix proteins (or major core proteins) are components of envelope-associated capsids, which line the inner surface of virus envelopes and are associated with viral membranes [[cite:PUB00014063]]. Matrix proteins are produced as part of Gag precursor polyproteins. During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved into major structural proteins by the viral protease, yielding the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and some smaller peptides. Gag-derived proteins govern the entire assembly and release of the virus particles, with matrix proteins playing key roles in Gag stability, capsid assembly, transport and budding. Although matrix proteins from different retroviruses appear to perform similar functions and can have similar structural folds which predominantly consist of four closely packed alpha-helices that are interconnected through loops, their primary sequences can be very different [[cite:PUB00055853]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents matrix proteins from beta-retroviruses such as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) (Simian Mason-Pfizer virus) and Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)  [[cite:PUB00055853], [cite:PUB00016324], [cite:PUB00016325]]. This entry also identifies matrix proteins from several eukaryotic endogenous retroviruses, which arise when one or more copies of the retroviral genome becomes integrated into the host genome [[cite:PUB00016320]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR003656	Zinc finger, BED-type	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The BED finger, which was named after the Drosophila proteins BEAF and DREF, is found in one or more copies in cellular regulatory factors and transposases from plants, animals and fungi. The BED finger is an about 50 to 60 amino acid residues domain that contains a characteristic motif with two highly conserved aromatic positions, as well as a shared pattern of cysteines and histidines that is predicted to form a zinc finger. As diverse BED fingers are able to bind DNA, it has been suggested that DNA-binding is the general function of this domain [[cite:PUB00007561]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some proteins known to contain a BED domain are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n &lt;li&gt; Animal, fungal and plant AC1 and Hobo-like transposases.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt; Caenorhabditis elegans protein dpy-20, a predicted cuticular-gene transcriptional regulator.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt; Drosophila BEAF (boundary element-associated factor), which is thought to be involved in chromatin insulation.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt; Drosophila DREF, a transcriptional regulator for S-phase genes.&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt; Tobacco 3AF1 and tomato E4/E8-BP1, which are light- and ethylene-regulated DNA binding proteins that contain two BED fingers [[cite:PUB00018276], [cite:PUB00018277]].&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;
IPR004028	Retroviral Gag polyprotein, M	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; The Gag polyprotein directs the assembly and release of virus particles from infected cells. The Gag polyprotein has three domains required for activity: an N-terminal membrane-binding (M) domain that directs Gag to the plasma membrane, an interaction (I) domain involved in Gag aggregation, and a late assembly (L) domain that mediates the budding process  [[cite:PUB00016316]]. During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is then cleaved into major structural proteins by the viral protease, yielding the matrix, capsid, nucleoprotein, and some smaller peptides. In Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the M domain consists of the first 85 residues of the matrix protein. However, unlike other Gag polyproteins, the M domain of RSV Gag is not myristylated, but retains full activity [[cite:PUB00016317]].This domain forms an alpha helical bundle structure  [[cite:PUB00016318]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the M domain of the Gag polyprotein found in avian retroviruses. This entry also identifies Gag polyproteins from several avian endogenous retroviruses, which arise when one or more copies of the retroviral genome becomes integrated into the host genome  [[cite:PUB00016319]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004107	Integrase, SAM-like, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Proteins containing this domain cleave DNA substrates by a series of staggered cuts, during which the protein becomes covalently linked to the DNA through a catalytic tyrosine residue at the carboxy end of the alignment [[cite:PUB00005224], [cite:PUB00004261]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt; The phage integrase N-terminal SAM-like domain is almost always found with the signature that defines the phage integrase family (see [interpro:IPR002104]).&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004189	Bacteriophage Mu, transposase	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This transposase is essential for integration, replication-transposition and excision of Bacteriophage Mu DNA. Transposition requires transposase and a transposition enhancer, and the DNA can be transposed into multiple sites in bacterial genomes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The crystal structure of the core domain of Mu transposase, MuA, has been determined. The first of two subdomains contains the active site and, despite very limited sequence homology, exhibits a striking similarity to the core domain of Human immunodeficiency virus 1 integrase. The enzymatic activity of MuA is known to be activated by formation of a DNA-bound tetramer of the protein [[cite:PUB00007414]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004191	Integrase, Tn916-type, N-terminal DNA binding	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The integrase family of site-specific recombinases catalyze a diverse array of DNA rearrangements in archaebacteria, eubacteria and yeast. The structure of the\r\nDNA binding domain of the the conjugative transposon Tn916 integrase protein was determined using NMR spectroscopy. The N-terminal domain was found to be structurally similar to the double stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD). Experimental evidence suggests that the integrase protein interacts with DNA using residues located on the face of its three stranded beta-sheet [[cite:PUB00007416]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004264	Transposase, Tnp1/En/Spm-like	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Proteins in this group are TNP1/EN/SPM-like transposon proteins with no known function from plants [[cite:PUB00034639]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004291	Transposase IS66, central domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain can be found in transposase IS66 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens [[cite:PUB00007470]]. Transposases are necessary for efficient DNA transposition. IS66 may cause genetic and structural variations of the T region and the vir region of the octopine Ti plasmids [[cite:PUB00007470]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004331	SPX domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The SPX domain is named after SYG1/Pho81/XPR1 proteins. This 180 residue length domain is found at the amino terminus of a variety of proteins. In the yeast protein SYG1, the N terminus directly binds to the G- protein beta subunit and inhibits transduction of the mating pheromone signal [[cite:PUB00007515]] suggesting that all the members of this family are involved in G-protein associated signal transduction. The C-terminal of these proteins often have an EXS domain ([interpro:IPR004342]) [[cite:PUB00007516]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The N-termini of several proteins involved in the regulation of phosphate transport, including the putative phosphate level sensors PHO81 from  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and NUC-2 from Neurospora crassa, are also members of this family [[cite:PUB00007517], [cite:PUB00007518]]. NUC-2 contains several ankyrin repeats ([interpro:IPR002110]).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Several members of this family are the XPR1 proteins: the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor confers susceptibility to infection with Murine leukemia virus (MLV) [[cite:PUB00007516]]. The similarity between SYG1, phosphate regulators and XPR1 sequences has been previously noted, as has the additional similarity to several predicted proteins, of unknown function, from Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00007516], [cite:PUB00007519]]. In addition, given the similarities between XPR1 and SYG1 and phosphate regulatory proteins, it has been proposed that XPR1 might be involved in G-protein associated signal transduction [[cite:PUB00043762], [cite:PUB00043763], [cite:PUB00043764]] and may itself function as a phosphate sensor [[cite:PUB00007516]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR004332	Transposase, MuDR, plant	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The plant MuDR transposase domain is present in plant (and some fungal) proteins that are presumed to be the transposases for Mutator transposable elements [[cite:PUB00007520], [cite:PUB00007521]]. The function of these proteins is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005054	Nepovirus coat protein	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The proteins of this entry are derived from nepoviruses. Together with comoviruses and picornaviruses,  nepoviruses are classified in the picornavirus superfamily of plus strand single-stranded RNA viruses. This family\r\n  aligns several nepovirus coat protein sequences. In several cases, this is found at the C terminus of the    RNA2-encoded viral polyprotein. The coat protein consists of three trapezoid-shaped beta-barrel domains, and\r\n        forms a pseudo T = 3 icosahedral capsid structure [[cite:PUB00007724]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005162	Retrotransposon gag domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposable elements (TEs) promote various chromosomal rearrangements more efficiently, and often more specifically, than\r\n                       other cellular processes. Retrotransposons are structurally similar to retroviruses and are bounded by long terminal repeats. This entry represents eukaryotic Gag or capsid-related retrotranspon-related proteins. There is a central motif QGXXEXXXXXFXXLXXH that is common to Retroviridae gag-proteins, but is poorly conserved [[cite:PUB00008354]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005167	Bunyavirus glycoprotein G1	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Bunyavirus has three genomic segments: small (S), middle-sized (M), and large (L). The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid and a non-structural protein. The M segment codes for two glycoproteins, G1 and G2, and another non-structural protein (NSm). The L segment codes for an RNA polymerase.  This entry represents the polyprotein region forming the G1 glycoprotein, which is the viral attachment protein [[cite:PUB00008359], [cite:PUB00019235]]. It interacts with the G2 polyprotein ([interpro:IPR005168]).&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005168	Bunyavirus glycoprotein G2	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Bunyavirus has three genomic segments: small (S), middle-sized (M), and large (L). The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid and a non-structural protein. The M segment codes for two glycoproteins, G1 and G2, and another non-structural protein (NSm). The L segment codes for an RNA polymerase.  This entry represents the polyprotein region forming the G2 glycoprotein, which interacts with the [interpro:IPR005167] G1 glycoprotein [[cite:PUB00009407]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005305	Nepovirus coat protein, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain oocurs within nepoviruses.  Together with comoviruses and picornaviruses, nepoviruses are classified in the picornavirus superfamily of plus strand single-stranded RNA viruses.  This domain aligns several nepovirus coat protein sequences.  In several cases, this is found at the C terminus of the RNA2-encoded viral polyprotein.  The coat protein consists of three trapezoid-shaped beta-barrel domains, and forms a pseudo T = 3 icosahedral capsid structure [[cite:PUB00007724]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005306	Nepovirus coat protein, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The members of this family are derived from nepoviruses.

IPR006119	Resolvase, N-terminal catalytic domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination plays an important role in DNA rearrangement in prokaryotic organisms. Two types of site-specific recombination are known to occur:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between inverted repeats resulting in the reversal of a DNA segment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between repeat sequences on two DNA molecules resulting in their cointegration, or between repeats on one DNA molecule resulting in the excision of a DNA fragment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination is characterised by a strand exchange mechanism that requires no DNA synthesis or high energy cofactor; the phosphodiester bond energy is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage and re-ligation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two unrelated families of recombinases are currently known [[cite:PUB00001148]]. The first, called the 'phage integrase' family, groups a number of bacterial phage and yeast plasmid enzymes. The second [[cite:PUB00003786]], called the 'resolvase' family, groups enzymes which share the following structural characteristics: an N-terminal catalytic and dimerization domain that contains a conserved serine residue involved in the transient covalent attachment to DNA, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain ([interpro:IPR006120]). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This N-terminal catalytic domains carries out site-specific recombination, process characterised by a strand exchange mechanism that requires no DNA synthesis or high energy cofactor since the phosphodiester bond energy is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage and re-ligation. It has an\nalpha/beta fold and consists of a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by\nthree alpha helices on one side and one helix on the other [[cite:PUB00019725]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR006120	Resolvase, HTH domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination plays an important role in DNA rearrangement in prokaryotic organisms. Two types of site-specific recombination are known to occur:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between inverted repeats resulting in the reversal of a DNA segment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between repeat sequences on two DNA molecules resulting in their cointegration, or between repeats on one DNA molecule resulting in the excision of a DNA fragment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination is characterised by a strand exchange mechanism that requires no DNA synthesis or high energy cofactor; the phosphodiester bond energy is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage and re-ligation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Two unrelated families of recombinases are currently known [[cite:PUB00001148]].

The second [[cite:PUB00003786]], called the 'resolvase' family, groups enzymes which share the following structural characteristics: an N-terminal catalytic and dimerization domain that contains a conserved serine residue involved in the transient covalent attachment to DNA [interpro:IPR006119], and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR006842	Transposase (putative), YhgA-like	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This is a family of putative transposases includes the YhgA sequence from Escherichia coli ([swissprot:P31667]) and several prokaryotic homologues [[cite:PUB00034642]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR008490	Transposase InsH, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This presumed domain is found at the N terminus of transposase insH and other related transposases.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR008739	Peptidase C28, foot-and-mouth virus L-proteinase	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This group of cysteine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family C28 (clan CA).The protein fold of the peptidase unit for members of this family resembles that of papain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The leader peptidase of Foot-and-mouth disease virus cleaves itself from the growing polyprotein and also cleaves the host translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4G), thus inhibiting 5'-cap dependent translation [[cite:PUB00011620]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.  Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring.  In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base.  Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan.  Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases.  From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families [[cite:PUB00011704]].  Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole.  Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases.  They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloromercuribenzoate.&lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold.  There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp).  A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a beta-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these.  Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases [[cite:PUB00076953]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold.  Proteins in the clan have an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys.  The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues [[cite:PUB00020025]]. Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a beta barrell.  The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys.  This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold.  Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides.  The fold shows a closed beta barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel [[cite:PUB00030423]].  The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR008740	Peptidase C30, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This group of cysteine peptidases correspond to MEROPS peptidase family C30 (clan PA(C)). These peptidases are related to serine endopeptidases of family S1 and are restricted to RNA viruses, where they are involved in  viral polyprotein processing during  replication [[cite:PUB00011621], [cite:PUB00011622], [cite:PUB00011623]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This Coronavirus (CoV) domain, peptidase C30, is also known as 3C-like proteinase (3CL-pro), or CoV main protease (M-pro) domain. CoV M-pro is a dimer where each subunit is composed of three domains I, II and III. Domains I and II consist of six-stranded antiparallel beta barrels and together resemble the architecture of chymotrypsin, and of picornaviruses 3C proteinases. The substrate-binding site is located in a cleft between these two domains. The catalytic site is situated at the centre of the cleft. A long loop connects domain II to the C-terminal domain (domain III). This latter domain, a globular cluster of five helices, has been implicated in the proteolytic activity of M-pro. In the active site of M-pro, Cys and His form a catalytic dyad. In contrast to serine proteinases and other cysteine proteinases, which have a catalytic triad, there is no third catalytic residue present [[cite:PUB00011621], [cite:PUB00022402], [cite:PUB00048878], [cite:PUB00051210]]. Many drugs have been developed to inhibit CoV M-pro [[cite:PUB00094068]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR008745	Domain of unknown function DUF1717	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The domain is found towards the N terminus of the polyprotein of Apple stem grooving virus (strain P-209) (ASGV), Citrus tatter leaf virus and from Apple stem grooving virus (strain Korea) (ASGV) (Pear black necrotic leaf spot virus) [[cite:PUB00005590], [cite:PUB00011626], [cite:PUB00098066]].

IPR008906	HAT, C-terminal dimerisation domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This dimerisation domain is found at the C terminus of the  transposases of elements belonging to the Activator superfamily (hAT element superfamily). The isolated dimerisation domain forms extremely stable dimers &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; [[cite:PUB00011522], [cite:PUB00019671]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR009407	Viral polyprotein, parechovirus P3B	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The viral polyprotein of parechoviruses contains: coat protein VP0 (P1AB); coat protein VP3 (P1C); coat protein VP1 (P1D); picornain 2A ([intenz:3.4.22.29], core protein P2A); core protein P2B; core protein P2C; core protein P3A; genome-linked protein VPg (P3B); picornain 3C ([intenz:3.4.22.28], MEROPS peptidase subfamily 3CF: parechovirus picornain 3C (P3C)) [[cite:PUB00033908]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry consists of the genome-linked protein Vpg type P3B.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR009419	Viral polyprotein, parechovirus P3A	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The viral polyprotein of parechoviruses contains: coat protein VP0 (P1AB); coat protein VP3 (P1C); coat protein VP1 (P1D); picornain 2A ([intenz:3.4.22.29], core protein P2A); core protein P2B; core protein P2C; core protein P3A; genome-linked protein VPg (P3B); picornain 3C ([intenz:3.4.22.28], MEROPS peptidase subfamily 3CF: parechovirus picornain 3C (P3C))[[cite:PUB00033908]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry consists of the parechovirus P3A protein. P3A has been identified as a genome-linked protein (VPg), which is involved in replication [[cite:PUB00012339]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR009461	Non-structural protein NSP16, coronavirus-like	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain covers the NSP16 region of the coronavirus polyprotein. It was originally named NSP13 and later changed to NSP16 to distinguish it from the helicase region [[cite:PUB00012615]]. NSP16 has selective RNA binding properties and is a cap-0 binding protein. It contains a highly conserved catalytic tetrad (K-D-K-E) that is a hallmark of RNA 2'O-MTases [[cite:PUB00094082], [cite:PUB00099680]]. NSP16 plays a key role in viral replication as it is involved in immune response evasion. It mimics the human protein CMTr1 and, unlike CMTr1, it requires NSP10 as a binding partner to activate its enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00099680]]. Structural analysis in NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 identified a cryptic pocket (also present in other coronavirus such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) not present in human CMTr1, which may be a possible antiviral target.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR009878	Phlebovirus glycoprotein G2, fusion domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;HRTV is an insect-borne virus found in America that can infect humans. It belongs to the newly defined family Phenuiviridae, order Bunyavirales. HRTV contains three single-stranded RNA segments (L, M, and S). The M segment of the virus encodes a polyprotein precursor that is cleaved into two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Gc is a fusion protein facilitating virus entry into host cells [[cite:PUB00094395]]. G2 (also known as Gc) is necessary for optimal glycoprotein G1 (also found as Gn) expression and efficient production or viral-like particles and possibly for the cell infection, as G2 is determinant for cell fusion [[cite:PUB00094392]]. Phleboviral G2 fusion glycoprotein is both functionally and structurally analogous to the fusion glycoproteins of alphaviruses and flaviviruses, all of them recognize DC-SIGN receptor to enable viral attachment [[cite:PUB00094395]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This domain consists of the N-terminal and middle domains, known as fusion domain, of several Phlebovirus glycoprotein G2 sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR009879	Phlebovirus nonstructural NS-M	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry consists of several Phlebovirus nonstructural NS-M proteins, which represent the N-terminal region of the M polyprotein precursor. The function of this family is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR010094	Transposase (putative), N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the N-terminal region of a family of putative transposases found in the largest copy number in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. The three homologues in Bacillus anthracis are each split into two ORFs and this entry represents the upstream ORF.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR010095	Transposase IS605, OrfB, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a region of a sequence similarity between a family of putative transposases of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, smaller related proteins from Bacillus anthracis, putative transposes described by [interpro:IPR001959], and other proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR010359	IrrE N-terminal-like domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry includes the catalytic domain of the protein ImmA (MEROPS identifier M78.001), which is a metallopeptidase containing an HEXXH zinc-binding motif.  ImmA is encoded on a conjugative transposon. Conjugating bacteria are able to transfer conjugative transposons that can, for example, confer resistance to antibiotics. The transposon is integrated into the chromosome, but during conjugation excises itself and then moves to the recipient bacterium and re-integrate into its chromosome. Typically a conjugative tranposon enodes only the proteins required for this activity and the proteins that regulate it. During exponential growth, the ICEBs1 transposon of Bacillus subtilis is inactivated by the immunity repressor protein ImmR, which is encoded by the transposon and represses the genes for excision and transfer. Cleavage of ImmR relaxes repression and allows transfer of the transposon. ImmA has been shown to be essential for the cleavage of ImmR [[cite:PUB00066798]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This domain is also found in in metalloprotease IrrE, a central regulator of DNA damage repair in Deinococcaceae [[cite:PUB00051490]], HTH-type transcriptional regulators RamB [[cite:PUB00074928]] and PrpC [[cite:PUB00074929]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR010659	Reverse transcriptase connection	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is known as the connection domain. This domain lies between the thumb and palm domains [[cite:PUB00012846]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR010661	Reverse transcriptase thumb	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is known as the thumb domain. It is composed of a four helix bundle [[cite:PUB00012846]]. Reverse transcriptase converts the viral RNA genome into double-stranded viral DNA. Reverse transcriptase often occurs in a polyprotein; with integrase, ribonuclease H and/or protease, which is cleaved before the enzyme takes action. The impact of antiretroviral treatment on the first 400 amino acids of HIV reverse transcriptase is good. Little is known, however, of the antiretroviral drug impact on the C-terminal domains of Pol, which includes the thumb, connection and RNase H [[cite:PUB00043354]]. Evidence suggests that these might be well conserved domains.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR012424	Conjugative transposon, TraJ, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the C-terminal domain of these proteins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Proteins in this entry are designated TraJ and are found in a proposed transfer region of a class of conjugative transposon found primarily in the Bacteroides lineage. They are related to conjugation system proteins in the Proteobacteria, including TrbL of Agrobacterium Ti plasmids and VirB6. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR012884	Excisionase-like	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The phage-encoded excisionase protein (Xis, [swissprot:P03699]) is involved in excisive recombination by regulating the assembly of the excisive intasome and by inhibiting viral integration. It adopts an unusual winged-helix structure in which two alpha helices are packed against two extended strands. Also present in the structure is a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, whose strands are connected by a four-residue wing. During interaction with DNA, helix alpha2 is thought to insert into the major groove, while the wing contacts the adjacent minor groove or phosphodiester backbone. The C-terminal region of Xis is involved in interaction with phage-encoded integrase (Int), and a putative C-terminal alpha helix may fold upon interaction with Int and/or DNA [[cite:PUB00016583]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR012922	ORF D-335-like	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The sequences featured in this family are similar to a probable integrase ([swissprot:P20214]) expressed by the SSV1 virus of the archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae. This protein may be necessary for the integration of the virus into the host genome by a process of site-specific recombination [[cite:PUB00014897]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR013016	Peptidase C16, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry contains coronavirus cysteine endopeptidases that belong to MEROPS peptidase family C16 (subfamiles C16A and C16B, clan CA). These peptidases are involved in viral polyprotein processing. All coronaviruses encode between one and two accessory cysteine proteinases that recognise and process one or two sites in the amino-terminal half of the replicase polyprotein during assembly of the viral replication complex. MHV, HCoV and TGEV encode two accesssory proteinases, called coronavirus papain-like proteinase 1 and 2 (PL1-PRO and PL2-PRO). IBV and SARS encodes only one called PL-PRO [[cite:PUB00011622]]. Coronavirus papain-like proteinases 1 and 2 have restricted specificities, cleaving respectively two and one bond(s) in the polyprotein. This restricted activity may be due to extended specificity sites: Arg or Lys at the cleavage site position P5 are required for PL1-PRO [[cite:PUB00017034]], and Phe at the cleavage site position P6 is required for PL2-PRO [[cite:PUB00017035]]. PL1-PRO releases p28 and p65 from the N terminus of the polyprotein; PL2-PRO cleaves between p210 and p150. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nThe peptidase family C16 domain is about 260 amino acids in length. This domain is predicted to have an alpha-beta structural organisation known as the papain-like fold. It consists of three alpha-helices and three strands of antiparallel beta-sheet [[cite:PUB00017036]]. This domain has a catalytic dyad consisting of a Cys and a downstream His [[cite:PUB00011622], [cite:PUB00017034], [cite:PUB00017036]]. The nucleophilic Cys occurs in the motif Asn-Cys-Xaa-Yaa in which Xaa is an aromatic, hydrophobic residue and Yaa is an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid. There is little conservation around the general base His. This peptidase domain also contains Cys residues involved in the formation of a zinc-binding finger which connects the left and right hand domains of a papain-like fold, and may be involved in substrate binding or control the movement of the catalytic domain [[cite:PUB00017036]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR013103	Reverse transcriptase, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses. This entry includes reverse transcriptases not recognised by [interpro:IPR000477] [[cite:PUB00001193]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR013544	Domain of unknown function DUF1725	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found at the C terminus of many eukaryotic and a few bacterial sequences. Many of its members are annotated as being putative L1 retrotransposons or LINE-1 reverse transcriptase homologues. The region in question is found repeated in some family members. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR013614	Viral polyprotein, Caliciviridae N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found at the N terminus of non-structural viral polyproteins of the Caliciviridae subfamily. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR013648	Polyprotein, Potyviridae	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found in polyproteins of the viral Potyviridae taxon. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR014817	Gag protein p6	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;HIV protein p6 contains two late-budding domains (L domains) which are short sequence motifs essential for viral particle release.  p6 interacts with the endosomal sorting complex and represents a docking site for several cellular and binding factors [[cite:PUB00035401]].  The PTAP motif interacts with the cellular budding factor TSG101 [[cite:PUB00035401]].  This domain is also found in some chimpanzee immunodeficiency virus (SIV-cpz) proteins. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR014832	TnsA endonuclease C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Tn7 transposase is composed of proteins TnsA and TnsB.  DNA breakage at the 5'-end of the transposon is carried out by TnsA, and breakage and joining at the 3'-end is carried out by TnsB. The C-terminal domain of TnsA binds DNA. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR014833	TnsA endonuclease, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Tn7 transposase is composed of proteins TnsA and TnsB.  DNA breakage at the 5'-end of the transposon is carried out by TnsA, and breakage and joining at the 3'-end is carried out by TnsB. The N-terminal domain of TnsA is catalytic. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR014834	Gag protein p15	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Gag p15 is a viral membrane-binding matrix protein which is alpha helical in structure. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR014872	Dicistrovirus, capsid-polyprotein, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found in the Dicistroviruses (Picornavirus) that include Cripavirus capsid proteins, (which are positive stranded ssRNA viruses) such as Cricket paralysis virus (CRPV). It forms an all beta sheet structure [[cite:PUB00035375]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR015094	Integrase, lambda-type, N-terminal DNA-binding	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The amino terminal domain of bacteriophage lambda integrase folds into a three-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet that packs against a C-terminal alpha-helix, adopting a fold that is structurally related to the three-stranded beta-sheet family of DNA-binding domains (which includes the GCC-box DNA-binding domain and the N-terminal domain of Tn916 integrase). This domain is responsible for high-affinity binding to each of the five DNA arm-type sites and is also a context-sensitive modulator of DNA cleavage [[cite:PUB00028838]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR015378	Transposase-like, Mu, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found in various prokaryotic integrases and transposases. It adopts a beta-barrel structure with Greek-key topology [[cite:PUB00007414]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR015401	Transposase, MuDR, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This N-terminal domain is functionally uncharacterised and found in various Oryza sativa (Rice) mutator-like transposases. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR017894	HTH domain, IS21 transposase-type	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Autonomous  mobile genetic elements such as transposons or insertion sequences (IS) encode an enzyme, called transposase, required for excising and inserting the mobile element. The IS21 is among the largest of bacterial IS elements and encodes  a  transposase  designated as istA (ORF1) as well as a second protein istB   (ORF2)   and   represents  the  IS21/IS408/IS1162  family  [[cite:PUB00007262]].  The transposases  of  IS21-like  IS  contain a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, represented by this entry, in the N-terminal part that probably binds to DNA. An integrase catalytic domain (see [interpro:IPR001584]) forms  the  central  part  of  these  IS21/IS408/IS1162  family transposases.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On  the  basis of sequence similarities, two types of HTH-domains can be found in IS21-like transposases.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The  first,  IS21 transposase-type HTH domain, occurs in transposases from the following elements:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;IS21 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;IS1326 from P. aeruginosa&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;IS640 from Shigella sonnei&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;IS5376 from Bacillus stearothermophilus&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;IS232 from Bacillus thuringiensis&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;IS21-like from Bacteroides fragilis&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;A potential insertion element from Chelatobacter heintzii&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The  second is a IS408/IS1162 transposase-type HTH domain. Some proteins known to contain this domain:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;A putative transposase y4uI from Rhizobium sp. (strain NGR234)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;A putative transposase y4bL/y4kJ/y4tB, also from strain NGR234&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;Transposase from IS408 from Burkholderia cepacia&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;Transposase from IS1162 from Pseudomonas fluorescens&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the IS21 transposase-type HTH domain.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR017895	Helix-turn-helix, IS408/IS1162 transposase-type	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Autonomous  mobile genetic elements such as transposons or insertion sequences (IS) encode an enzyme, called transposase, required for excising and inserting the mobile element. The IS21 is among the largest of bacterial IS elements and encodes  a  transposase  designated as istA (ORF1) as well as a second protein istB   (ORF2)   and   represents  the  IS21/IS408/IS1162  family  [[cite:PUB00007262]].

IPR018061	Retropepsins	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Aspartic peptidases, also known as aspartyl proteases ([intenz:3.4.23.-]), are widely distributed proteolytic enzymes [[cite:PUB00001330], [cite:PUB00000093], [cite:PUB00000349]] known to exist in vertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, retroviruses and some plant viruses. All known aspartic peptidases are endopeptidases.  A water molecule, activated by two aspartic acid residues, acts as the nucleophile in catalysis.  Aspartic peptidases can be grouped into five clans, each of which shows a unique structural fold [[cite:PUB00000522]].\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peptidases in clan AA are either bilobed (family A1 or the pepsin family) or are a homodimer (all other families in the clan, including retropepsin from HIV-1/AIDS) [[cite:PUB00042504]].  Each lobe consists of a single domain with a closed beta-barrel and each lobe contributes one Asp to form the active site.  Most peptidases in the clan are inhibited by the naturally occurring small-molecule inhibitor pepstatin [[cite:PUB00076784]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AC contains the single family A8: the signal peptidase 2 family.  Members of the family are found in all bacteria.  Signal peptidase 2 processes the premurein precursor, removing the signal peptide.  The peptidase has four transmembrane domains and the active site is on the periplasmic side of the cell membrane.  Cleavage occurs on the amino side of a cysteine where the thiol group has been substituted by a diacylglyceryl group.  Site-directed mutagenesis has identified two essential aspartic acid residues which occur in the motifs GNXXDRX and FNXAD (where X is a hydrophobic residue) [[cite:PUB00076785]].  No tertiary structures have been solved for any member of the family, but because of the intramembrane location, the structure is assumed not to be pepsin-like.&lt;/li&gt; \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AD contains two families of transmembrane endopeptidases: A22 and A24.  These are also known as \"GXGD peptidases\" because of a common GXGD motif which includes one of the pair of catalytic aspartic acid residues.  Structures are known for members of both families and show a unique, common fold with up to nine transmembrane regions [[cite:PUB00066803]].  The active site aspartic acids are located within a large cavity in the membrane into which water can gain access [[cite:PUB00065205]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AE contains two families, A25 and A31.  Tertiary structures have been solved for members of both families and show a common fold consisting of an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich, in which the beta sheet is five stranded [[cite:PUB00011023], [cite:PUB00021296]].&lt;/li&gt;  \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AF contains the single family A26.  Members of the clan are membrane-proteins with a unique fold.  Homologues are known only from bacteria.  The structure of omptin (also known as OmpT) shows a cylindrical barrel containing ten beta strands inserted in the membrane with the active site residues on the outer surface [[cite:PUB00011707]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;There are two families of aspartic peptidases for which neither structure nor active site residues are known and these are not assigned to clans.   Family A5 includes thermopsin, an endopeptidase found only in thermophilic archaea.  Family A36 contains sporulation factor SpoIIGA, which is known to process and activate sigma factor E, one of the transcription factors that controls sporulation in bacteria [[cite:PUB00076786]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This group of aspartic peptidases belong to the peptidase clan AA.  The clan includes the single domain aspartic proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons, and badnaviruses (plant dsDNA viruses) which are active as homodimers.   While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin [[cite:PUB00000349], [cite:PUB00032703]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A2 includes the peptidase (retropepsin, EC 3.4.23.16) from the human immunodeficiency virus and other retroviruses. In most retroviruses, the peptidase is encoded as a segment of a polyprotein (usually the pol polyprotein, which includes the peptidase, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and an integrase, but occassionally the gag polyprotein) which it cleaves during viral maturation to release individual proteins.  Some retrotransposon polyproteins also contain a homologous, retropepsin-like peptidase which is also a member of family A2.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A3 includes peptidases from the double-stranded DNA plant viruses known as badnaviruses or pararetroviruses. The viral genome includes genes (ORFs IV and V) that encodes polyproteins.  The ORF V polyprotein contains the peptidase and a reverse transcriptase.  The peptidase processes the ORF IV polyprotein, which includes the viral coat protein [[cite:PUB00076788]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A9 includes peptidases from spumaretroviruses, and the peptidase is a component of either the gag and pol polyprotein, which is processes [[cite:PUB00076789]].  The structure has been solved for the peptidase from simian foamy virus and shows a retropepsin-like fold [[cite:PUB00048142]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A11 includes polyprotein-processing peptidases from retrotransposons such as the copia transposon from &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;.  No tertiary structure has been solved for any member of the family, and family A11 is included in clan AA on the basis of the similar motif around the active site  Asp.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A28 includes the yeast DNA-damage inducible protein 1 which is a component of the DNA repair pathway.  The tertiary structure shows a retropepsin-like fold [[cite:PUB00041573]].  This peptidase is not a component of a polyprotein.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Family A32 includes the bacterial PerP peptidase which converts the transmembrane factor PodJ from a form that recruits proteins for pilus formation, to a truncated form that recruits proteins for stalk formation.  This converts the bacterium from a motile form to the sessile form found in biofilms [[cite:PUB00076754]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR018289	MULE transposase domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found in Mutator-like elements (MULE)-encoded tranposases, some of which also contain a zinc-finger motif [[cite:PUB00044801], [cite:PUB00044386]].   This domain is also found in a transposase for the insertion sequence element IS256 in transposon Tn4001 [[cite:PUB00044802]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR018995	RNA synthesis protein NSP10, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; Non-structural protein NSP10 is involved in RNA synthesis. It is synthesised as part of a replicase polyprotein, whose cleavage generates many non-structural proteins [[cite:PUB00045296]]. NSP10 contains two zinc binding motifs and forms two anti-parallel helices which are stacked against an irregular beta sheet [[cite:PUB00040863]]. A cluster of basic residues on the protein surface suggests a nucleic acid-binding function. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The small NSP10 subunit is among the more conserved coronavirus proteins. It interacts with NSP14 and NSP16 and regulates their respective exonuclease (ExoN) and ribose-2'-O-MTase (2'-O-MTase) activities [[cite:PUB00094087]]. When binding to the N-terminal of NSP14, NSP10 allows the ExoN active site to adopt a stably closed conformation, allowing efficient hydrolysis of dsRNA [[cite:PUB00094105]].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One NSP10 residue, Tyr-96, is of particular interest. The aromatic nature of Tyr-96 plays a crucial role in the NSP10-NSP16 interaction and in the activation of the NSP16 2'-O-MTase activity as well as in the NSP10-NSP14 interaction. This residue is specific for SARS-CoV NSP10, and is a phenylalanine in other coronavirus homologues [[cite:PUB00094106]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR021027	Transposase, putative, helix-turn-helix domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This entry represents an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain found in a variety of putative transposases [[cite:PUB00002091], [cite:PUB00001825], [cite:PUB00001858]]. It is usually associated with [pfam:PF01385] and [pfam:PF07282]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR021081	Nepovirus subgroup A, polyprotein	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; Proteins in this entry are typically between 259 and 1110 amino acids in length. They are found in association with [pfam:PF03688], [pfam:PF03689] and [pfam:PF03391]. This entry includes RNA2 polyprotein (Protein 2A) which is implicated in RNA2 replication.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR021824	Capsid protein C, pestivirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This domain is found in the genome polyprotein from Pestivirus. This domain covers part of the capsid protein C region in the polyprotein. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR022000	Min27-like integrase, DNA-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This presumed domain is functionally uncharacterised. This domain family is found in bacteria and viruses, and is approximately 90 amino acids in length. The family is found in association with  [pfam:PF00589]. It is likely that this domain acts to bind DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR022101	GB virus C, polyprotein N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This entry defines the N-terminal domain of the polyprotein of GB virus C; its function is not known. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR022218	ToxR activated gene A lipoprotein domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This domain is found in bacterial lipoprotein, and is approximately 140 amino acids in length. The domain is found in association with [pfam:PF10462]. There is a conserved GAG sequence motif. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR022733	DPUP/SUD, C-terminal, betacoronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found in betacoronavirus non-structural protein NSP3, and is about 65 amino acids in length. It was originally thought to exist only in SARS-coronaviruses, and so was termed the SARS-unique domain (SUD), however this has since been shown to be incorrect. The domain is also known as DPUP (domain preceding Ubl2 and PL2pro).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NSP3 is the product of ORF1a and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein [[cite:PUB00094069], [cite:PUB00050012]]. The SUD domain has three globular domains, SUD-N (N-terminal), SUD-M (middle region of SUD), and SUD-C (C-terminal). SUD-C adopts a fold consisting of seven beta-strands arranged in an anti-parallel beta-sheet, and two alpha-helices which are packed against the same side of the beta-sheet. It adopts a frataxin like fold with structural similarities to DNA-binding domains. It has been shown that SUD-C binds to single-stranded RNA and recognises purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases, but these interactions are stabilised in the presence of SUD-M. The function of this domain is not clear but studies of structural homologues of SUD-C suggest that it could be related to metal, adenylate and nucleic acid binding [[cite:PUB00062522]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR024266	Domain of unknown function DUF3806	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found at the C terminus of a family of bacterial proteins, whose function is unknown. In two related Bacteroides species the gene for members of this family lies immediately upstream from a putative ATP binding component of an ATP transporter and a putative histidinol phosphatase. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The structure of this domain is strikingly similar to the N-terminal structure of 1ma7, whose C-terminal domain is a phage integrase.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR024343	Capsid protein VP4, dicistrovirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain represents VP4, a minor capsid protein from dicistroviridae which is processed from the capsid polyprotein. The dicistroviridae is a group of small, RNA-containing viruses that are closely structurally related to the picornaviridae. VP4 is a short, extended polypeptide chain found within the viral capsid, at the interface between the external protein shell and packaged RNA genome [[cite:PUB00035375]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR024375	Non-structural protein NSP3, SUD-M domain, betacoronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the macrodomain referred to as SUD-M (middle SUD subdomain) of the SARS-unique domain (SUD) which binds G-quadruplexes (unusual nucleic-acid structures formed by consecutive guanosine nucleotides) [[cite:PUB00095930]]. It can be found in non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and related coronaviruses  [[cite:PUB00056024]]. NSP3 binds to viral RNA, nucleocapsid protein, as well as other viral proteins, and participates in polyprotein processing. It is a multifunctional protein comprising up to 16 different domains and regions [[cite:PUB00094069]]. In SARS-CoV the SUD-M (527-651) domain has been shown to bind single-stranded poly(A). It has been shown through the contact area with this RNA on the protein surface, and the electrophoretic mobility shift assays, that SUD-M has higher affinity for purine bases than for pyrimidine bases [[cite:PUB00048150]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SUD consists of three globular domains separated by short linker peptide segments: SUD-N, SUD-M, and SUD-C [[cite:PUB00062522]]. Among these, SUD-N and SUD-M are macrodomains. The SUD-N domain is a related macrodomain which also binds G-quadruplexes [[cite:PUB00050012]]. While SUD-N is specific to the NSP3 of SARS and betacoronaviruses of the sarbecovirus subgenera (B lineage), SUD-M is present in most NSP3 proteins except the NSP3 from betacoronaviruses of the embecovirus subgenera (A lineage). SUD-M, despite its name, is not specific to SARS. SUD-C adopts a frataxin-like fold, has structural similarity to DNA-binding domains of DNA-modifying enzymes, binds single-stranded RNA, and regulates the RNA binding behavior of the SUD-M macrodomain. SARS-CoV Nsp3 contains a third macrodomain (the X-domain). The X-domain may function as a module binding poly(ADP-ribose); however, SUD-N and SUD-M do not bind ADP-ribose, as the triple glycine sequence involved in its binding is not conserved in these [[cite:PUB00094069]].&lt;/p&gt; Nsp3c-N and Nsp3c-M each display a typical alpha/beta/alpha Macro domain fold, in spite of the complete absence of sequence similarities. The central beta sheet with six beta strands in the order beta1-beta6-beta5-beta2-beta4-beta3 is flanked by two (or three) helices on either side. Only the last strand, beta3, is antiparallel to the other strands. Currently, most known functions of Nsp3c-N/M are connected with RNA binding. All the residues important for binding ADP-ribose and for de-MARylation/de-PARylation activity are not conserved in Nsp3c-N/M; therefore Nsp3c-N/M cannot bind ADP-ribose. Both Nsp3c-N and Nsp3c-M domains bind unusual nucleic acid structures formed by consecutives guanosine nucleotides, where four strands of nucleic acid are forming a superhelix (so-called G-quadruplexes) [[cite:PUB00050012], [cite:PUB00048150], [cite:PUB00062522], [cite:PUB00095930], [cite:PUB00094069]].
IPR024387	Peptidase C3G, Picornavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a rice tungro spherical waikavirus-type peptidase that belongs to MEROPS peptidase family C3G. It is a picornain 3C-type protease, and is responsible for the self-cleavage of the positive single-stranded polyproteins of a number of plant viral genomes. The location of the protease activity of the polyprotein is at the C-terminal end, adjacent and N-terminal to the putative RNA polymerase [[cite:PUB00056181], [cite:PUB00056182]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viruses in the order Picornavirales infect different vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant hosts and are responsible for a variety of human, animal, and plant diseases. These viruses have a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome that generally translates a large precursor polyprotein which is proteolytically cleaved after translation to generate mature functional viral proteins. This process is usually mediated by (more than one) proteases, and a 3C (for the family Picornaviridae) or 3C-like (3CL) protease (for other families) plays a central role in the cleavage of the viral precursor polyprotein. In addition to this key role, 3C/3C-like protease is able to cleave a number of host proteins to remodel the cellular environment for virus reproduction [[cite:PUB00032759], [cite:PUB00094816], [cite:PUB00050441], [cite:PUB00056357], [cite:PUB00056400], [cite:PUB00094817]]. The Picornavirales 3C/3C-like protease domain forms the MEROPS peptidase family C3 (picornain family) of clan PA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3C/3CL protease domain adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold with a cysteine nucleophile in place of a commonly found serine which suggests that the cysteine and serine perform an analogous catalytic function. The catalytic triad is made of a histidine, an aspartate/glutamate and the conserved cysteine in this sequential order. The 3C/3CL protease domain folds into two antiparallel beta barrels that are linked by a loop with a short alpha-helix in its middle, and flanked by two other alpha-helices at the N- and C-terminal. The two barrels are topologically equivalent and are formed by six antiparallel beta strands with the first four organised into a Greek key motif. The active-site residues are located in the cleft between the two barrels with the nucleophilic Cys from the C-terminal barrel and the general acid base His-Glu/Asp from the N-terminal barrel [[cite:PUB00032759], [cite:PUB00094816], [cite:PUB00056357]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR024445	ISXO2-like transposase domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain probably functions as an integrase that is found in a wide variety of transposases, including ISXO2.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR024456	Integrase catalytic domain, putative	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;P&gt;Phage integrase proteins cleave DNA substrates by a series of staggered cuts, during which the protein becomes covalently linked to the DNA through a catalytic tyrosine residue at the carboxy end of the alignment [[cite:PUB00005224], [cite:PUB00004261]].&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents the catalytic domain from a family of putative prophage DNA-binding integrases.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR024457	Putative integrase, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;P&gt;Phage integrase proteins cleave DNA substrates by a series of staggered cuts, during which the protein becomes covalently linked to the DNA through a catalytic tyrosine residue at the carboxy end of the alignment [[cite:PUB00005224], [cite:PUB00004261]].&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents the N-terminal predicted alpha-helical domain found in a family of putative prophage DNA-binding integrases.&lt;/p&gt;

IPR025166	Integrase, DNA-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found at the N terminus of a wide variety of phage integrase proteins. It is predicted to bind DNA. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR025246	Transposase IS30-like HTH domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This helix-turn-helix domain is found in some transposases and is likely to be DNA-binding.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR025269	Phage integrase SAM-like domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain was originally identified by clustering human gut metagenomic sequences [[cite:PUB00055601]]. It appears related to the N-terminal domain of phage integrases.&lt;/p&gt;

IPR025314	Domain of unknown function DUF4219	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is very short and is found at the N-terminal of many Gag-pol polyproteins from retrotransposons and related sequences. There is a highly conserved YxxWxxxM sequence motif.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR025399	Domain of unknown function DUF4372	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain of unknown function often occurs at the N terminus of putative transposases.&lt;/p&gt;

IPR025775	Birnavirus VP4 protease domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Viruses of the Birnaviridae family infect animal species belonging to\r\nvertebrates, molluscs, insects and rotifers and are characterised by their bi-\r\nsegmented double-stranded RNA genome (segments A and B). Segment A encodes two\r\noverlapping reading frames and the larger open reading frame encodes a\r\npolyprotein (NH2-pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH). The polyprotein is processed through the\r\nproteolytic activity of VP4 to generate pVP2 and VP3. During virus assembly\r\npVP2 is further processed by VP4 to generate the capsid protein VP2 and\r\nstructural peptides. Evolutionarily, the VP4 protease of the Birnaviridae\r\nfamily belongs to clan SJ and family S50 [[cite:PUB00057993], [cite:PUB00041024], [cite:PUB00048729]].\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe birnavirus VP4 protease domain displays a catalytic serine/lysine dyad in\r\nits active site. The birnavirus VP4 protease domain has an alpha/beta fold [[cite:PUB00041024], [cite:PUB00048729]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR025898	Tc3 transposase, DNA binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Tc3 is transposase with a specific DNA-binding domain which contains three alpha-helices, two of which form a helix-turn-helix motif which makes four base-specific contacts with the major groove. The N terminus makes contacts with the minor groove. There is a base specific recognition between Tc3 and the transposon DNA. The DNA binding domain forms a dimer in which each monomer binds a separate transposon end. This implicates that the dimer has a role in synapsis and is necessary for the simultaneous cleavage of both transposon termini [[cite:PUB00001309]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR025910	Plant viral polyprotein P1, serine peptidase domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the serine peptidase at the N terminus of P1 protein of the Potyviridae polyproteins. The catalytic triad in P1 from the ssRNA positive-strand Brome streak mosaic rymovirus, is His-311, Asp-322 and Ser-355 [[cite:PUB00058227], [cite:PUB00058228], [cite:PUB00058229], [cite:PUB00058230]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR026400	Bunyavirus nonstructural protein NSm	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;  This entry represents a protein region that is cleaved from a bunyavirus polyprotein to become the nonstructural protein NSm (encoded by the M segment). This region is flanked by glycoprotein GP2 and glycoprotein GP1. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR026470	Flavivirus envelope glycoprotein E, Stem/Anchor domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;  This entry describes the C-terminal domain, containing a stem region followed by two transmembrane anchor domains, of the envelope protein E. This protein is cleaved from the large flavivirus polyprotein, which yields three structural and seven nonstructural proteins [[cite:PUB00060493]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR026889	Transposase zinc-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is likely to be a zinc-binding domain. It is found at the N terminus of transposases belonging to the IS91 family.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR026960	Reverse transcriptase zinc-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain would appear to be a zinc-binding region of a putative reverse transcriptase.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR028259	AP2-like integrase, N-terminal domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the AP2-like domains found N-terminal in a variety of phage integrase proteins, including the ICEBs1 integrase from Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00067776]]. Presumably these domains are DNA-binding.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR029104	Retro-transcribing virus envelope glycoprotein	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a group of mammalian proteins that have retroviral origin. They are retrovirus K envelope glycoprotein genes that entry into human ancestral genome millions of years ago [[cite:PUB00070228]]. These endogenous envelope proteins have lost their original fusogenic properties [[cite:PUB00070229]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR029261	Transposase IS204/IS1001/IS1096/IS1165, zinc-finger	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a zinc-finger domain found in transposases for insertion sequence IS204, IS1001, IS1096 and IS1165.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR029323	Equine arteritis virus, non-structural protein 1	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The replicase polyproteins of the Nidoviruses such as, porcine arterivirus PRRSV, equine arterivirus EAV, human coronavirus 229E, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), are predicted to be cleaved into 14 non-structural proteins (nsps) by the nsp4 main proteinase  [interpro:IPR008760] and three accessory proteinases residing in nsp1-alpha, nsp1-beta and nsp2 [[cite:PUB00057982], [cite:PUB00070014], [cite:PUB00052898]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the two nsp1 proteins that together act in a papain-like way to separate off the rest of the various functional domains of the polyprotein. Once inside the host cell, this nsp1 interferes with the regulation of interferon, thereby enabling the virus to replicate [[cite:PUB00065853], [cite:PUB00070015]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR029472	Retrotransposon Copia-like, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found in the N terminus of the Copia-like proteins from eukaryotes. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR029480	Transposase-associated domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found in some putative transposases from plants.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR030399	Pestivirus NS2, peptidase C74	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Pestiviruses are animal pathogens that are recognised as a separate genus\r\nof the family Flaviviridae. The pestiviral genome is a single-stranded RNA of\r\npositive polarity. It is translated into a large polyprotein, which is\r\ncotranslationally and posttranslationally processed by viral and cellular\r\nproteases. Pestivirus nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) is predicted to have a\r\nmultidomain organisation. The C-terminal-most domain of NS2 is a cysteine\r\nautoprotease responsible for NS2-3 cleavage. The catalytic triad is formed by\r\nHis, Glu, and Cys. The pestivirus NS2 protease domain contains five Cys and\r\none His organised in a linear fashion, suggesting the presence of a\r\nmononuclear ZnB site [[cite:PUB00072580]]. The pestivirus NS2 protease domain forms peptidase family C74.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The entry represents the entire pestivirus NS2 protease domain.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR031159	Helper-component proteinase (HC-Pro) cysteine protease (CPD) domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Potyviruses form one of the most numerous groups of plant viruses and are a major cause of crop loss worldwide. The helper-component proteinase (HC-Pro) is an indispensable, multifunctional protein of members of the genus Potyvirus and other viruses of the family Potyviridae. It is directly involved in diverse steps of viral infection, such as aphid plant-to-plant transmission, polyprotein processing, and suppression of host antiviral RNA silencing. HC-Pro is generally divided into three functional domains: a N-terminal domain, a central region, and a cysteine protease domain (CPD) in the C-terminal region. The HC-Pro CPD domain has a protease activity that autocatalytically cleaves a Gly-Gly dipeptide at its own C terminus to release HC-Pro from the rest of the viral polyprotein. Cysteine and histidine residues form the catalytic dyad at the active site. The HC-Pro CPD domain constitutes the peptidase family C6 of the CA clan [[cite:PUB00074812]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The HC-Pro CPD domain adopts a compact oval-shaped alpha/beta fold. The secondary structure elements include four alpha-helices (alpha1-alpha4) and two short beta-strands (beta1 and beta2) arranged in the order alpha1-alpha2-alpha3-beta1-beta2-alpha4. In addition, two 3(10) helices are located between alpha3 and beta1 and downstream of alpha4. The four helices form a helix bundle packed against one face of a short beta-hairpin formed by strands beta1 and beta2. The catalytic residue Cys is located at the N terminus of helix alpha1, and the other catalytic residue His is located on strand beta2. The substrate binding cleft is lined by the loop connecting helices alpha2 and alpha3 and the N-terminal region of helix alpha1 on one side and by strand beta2 on the other side [[cite:PUB00074812]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents the CPD domain of the HC-Pro protein. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR031792	Surface antigen, GAG-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found in the surface antigen protein from the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis and related species. This domain expresses three clusters of basic residues, largely lysines, that are critical for heparin-binding and cell adhesion during bacterium-host cell adhesion. This domain binds to the host cell surface glycosaminoglycans or GAGs of the Streptococcus [[cite:PUB00076057]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR031857	Integrase SSV1, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represent the C-terminal catalytic domain of an integrase, SSV1, from  Sulfolobus shibatae. This domain is capable of DNA cleavage and ligation, but at efficiencies significantly lower than those of the full-length protein [[cite:PUB00061161], [cite:PUB00076085]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR032039	Alphacoronavirus nsp1	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the N-terminal region of the alphacoronovirus polyprotein, which contains non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). Nsp1 from alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) folds into a six-stranded beta-barrel fold with a long alpha helix on the rim of the barrel. This fold is shared with betacoronavirus SARS-CoV nsp1 [[cite:PUB00076175]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR032268	Capsid polyprotein VP90, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found at the C terminus of the capsid polyprotein VP90 from Turkey astrovirus. This is a globular domain found on the surface of the viral capsid that forms the capsid projections or spikes. Astroviruses cause diarrhoea in a variety of mammals and birds, and are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. The spike carries three conserved patches on its surface which could be candidates for avian receptor-binding sites [[cite:PUB00076250]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR032505	Non-structural protein NSP4, C-terminal, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This is the C-terminal domain of the coronavirus non-structural protein NSP4. NSP4 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. It is a membrane-spanning protein which is thought to anchor the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) to modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes. This predominantly alpha-helical domain is involved in protein-protein interactions [[cite:PUB00052994]]. It has been shown that in betacoronavirus, the coexpression of NSP3 and NSP4 results in a membrane rearrangement to induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), playing a critical role in SARS-CoV replication. There are two well conserved amino acid residues (H120 and F121) in NSP4 among betacoronavirus, which were demonstrated to be essential for membrane rearrangements during interaction with NSP3. This suggests that the specific details of the interaction between these two proteins varies among different coronavirus [[cite:PUB00094131], [cite:PUB00094132]]. &lt;/p&gt;

IPR032855	Arterivirus polyprotein, nsp2, immunogenic region	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is in a non-essential part of the nsp2 (non-structural protein) subunit section of the arterivirus polyprotein. This domain carries seven small sequence-regions that are predicted to be potential B-cell epitopes [[cite:PUB00076924], [cite:PUB00076925]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR034122	Retropepsin-like domain, bacterial	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry includes bacterial aspartate proteases that are retropepsin-like, i.e. like the enzymes from retrovirus and retrotransposons. While fungal and mammalian pepsin-like aspartate proteases are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, this family of bacteria aspartate proteases is half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate proteases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A32.  The RC1339/APRc protein from Rickettsia conorii has been characterized [[cite:PUB00076755]] and its tertiary structure determined [[cite:PUB00082702]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR034128	K02A2.6-like peptidase catalytic domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry includes a retropepsin-like domain of invertebrate retrotransposons with long terminal repeats [[cite:PUB00082720]].  Although none of the proteins have been characterised, the retropepsin-like domain is presumed to be an aspartate endopeptidase. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts [[cite:PUB00041573]]. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. In aspartate endopeptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified.  The retrotransposon aspartyl endopeptidase is synthesized as part of a polyprotein that also contains a reverse transcriptase and an integrase. The polyprotein is presumed to undergo specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. This group of aspartate endopeptidases is classified by MEROPS as peptidase family A28 [[cite:PUB00006548], [cite:PUB00041573]].&lt;/p&gt;

Retropepsins are related to fungal and mammalian pepsins. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N- and C-termini, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin.

IPR034170	Retropepsin-like catalytic domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the peptidase domain found in a group of retropepsin-like aspartic endopeptidases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements. This group of aspartic peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A [[cite:PUB00003578]]. Proteins containing this domain include retropepsins from human immunodeficiency viruses (MEROPS identifiers A02.001, A02.002) [[cite:PUB00038904]], Mason-Pfizer leukemia virus (A02.009), Rous sarcoma virus (A02.015), intracisternal A-particle (A02.016) [[cite:PUB00082805]], and \"endogenous viruses\" from human (A02.011) [[cite:PUB00081351]], rabbit (A02.024) and mouse (A02.060).&lt;/p&gt;

P3 contains a putative movement protein (MP), the capsid protein (CP), the aspartate protease (PR) and the reverse transcriptase (RT) with a ribonuclease H activity. PR proteolytically processes P3. The sequence DSGS is believed to be the RTBV protease active site [[cite:PUB00076788]]. The RTBV PR domain forms peptidase family A3 subfamily B [[cite:PUB00003578]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR040643	Murine leukemia virus integrase, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This is the C-terminal domain (CTD) which can be found in murine leukemia virus (MLV) integrase (IN) proteins. This domain interacts with the bromo and extraterminal (BET) proteins through the ET domain. This interaction provides a structural basis for global in vivo integration-site preferences and disruption of this interaction through truncation mutations affects the global targeting profile of MLV. This domain consists of an SH3 fold followed by a long unstructured tail [[cite:PUB00091198]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR040676	Domain of unknown function DUF5641	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This presumed domain is found in a range of retrotransposon polyproteins.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR040814	Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein, C-terminal domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the  C-terminal capsid-like domain of the Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). The Arc protein modulates the trafficking of AMPA-type glutamate receptors [[cite:PUB00054117], [cite:PUB00098831]]. The tertiary structure of this two-lobe capsid domain is similar to the capsid domain of HIV gag protein. The domain is thought to have evolved from the capsid domain of Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon [[cite:PUB00091279], [cite:PUB00098832]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR040903	Retroviral integrase, C-terminal SH3 domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This is the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) found in retroviral integrase, an essential retroviral enzyme that binds both termini of linear viral DNA and inserts them into a host cell chromosome. The CTD adopts an SH3-like fold. Each CTD makes contact with the phosphodiester backbone of both viral DNA molecules, essentially crosslinking the structure [[cite:PUB00055203]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR041053	Replicase polyprotein 1ab	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry relates to a regulatory domain found in replicase polyprotein 1ab found in Arterivirus. Structural studies of arterivirus helicase (nsp10), indicate that this domain undergoes conformational changes on substrate binding. Besides the large conformational change, it is suggested that the regions at the surface of domain 1B not directly involved in DNA binding may become flexible. For example, domain 1B residues Arg95, Gly125 and Ala131 become disordered after DNA binding. Together with domains 1A and 2A it forms a nucleic acid-binding channel where the single-stranded part of the DNA substrate is bound to [[cite:PUB00084255]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR041115	SMODS and SLOG-associating 2TM effector domain 5	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The SLATT domain contains two transmembrane helices. SLATT domains are generally predicted to function as pore-forming effectors in a class of conflict systems which are reliant on the production of second messenger nucleotide or nucleotide derivatives. SLATT domains are predicted to initiate cell suicide responses upon their activation. This SLATT family contains an additional C-terminal alpha-helix, and strictly associates with a reverse transcriptase domain, part of a predicted retroelement with diversity-generating potential [[cite:PUB00091021]].&lt;/p&gt;

This domain can also be found in animal retrotransposon-like proteins [[cite:PUB00091629]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents an RNase H-like domain found in a group of reverse transcriptases, including those transcribed as part of an enzymatic polyprotein.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR041419	TnsE, C-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The bacterial transposon Tn7 facilitates horizontal transfer by directing transposition into actively replicating DNA with the element-encoded protein TnsE. Structural analysis of the C-terminal domain of TnsE identified a central V-shaped loop that toggles between two distinct conformations. It is suggested that a conformational change within the C-terminal domain of TnsE underlies target site selection by regulating stable engagement of the target DNA while providing a signal for activating transposition [[cite:PUB00091570]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR041511	Putative DNA-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This is a putative DNA-binding protein dimerization domain found bacterial proteins such as CD3330, (a transposon-related DNA-binding protein from Clostridium difficile). Crystal structure analysis suggests that CD3330 N terminus is involved in dimer formation and also in crystal packing but the C terminus is open to solvent [[cite:PUB00091603]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR041577	Reverse transcriptase/retrotransposon-derived protein, RNase H-like domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities allow reverse transcriptases to convert the single-stranded retroviral RNA genome into double-stranded DNA, which is integrated into the host chromosome during infection [[cite:PUB00030812]]. This domain can also be found in animal retrotransposon-like proteins [[cite:PUB00091629]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents the RNase H-like domain found in a group of reverse transcriptases [[cite:PUB00030812], [cite:PUB00065088], [cite:PUB00091628]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR041588	Integrase zinc-binding domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This zinc-binding domain is found in a wide variety of integrase proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR041718	IS607-like transposase, catalytic domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Proteins containing this domain often also contain a DNA binding domain with homology to MerR/SoxR located N-terminal to the catalytic domain. Proteins containing this domain catalyze the transposition of insertion sequence (IS) elements such as IS607 from Helicobacter and IS1535 from Mycobacterium, and similar proteins from other bacteria and several archaeal species. IS elements are DNA segments that move to new sites in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes causing insertion mutations and gene rearrangements [[cite:PUB00091786], [cite:PUB00091787]]. This domain belongs to a larger group of catalytic domains found in serine recombinases, which catalyze site-specific recombination of DNA molecules by a concerted, four-strand cleavage and rejoining mechanism which involves a transient phosphoserine linkage between DNA and the enzyme. They are functionally versatile and include resolvases, invertases, integrases, and transposases [[cite:PUB00091785]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR042721	Transposase A from transposon Tn554, C-terminal catalytic domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the C-terminal domain of transposase A from transposon Tn554, which belongs to a DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme superfamily. The catalytic domain contains six conserved active site residues. The recombination reaction involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity [[cite:PUB00081708], [cite:PUB00081707], [cite:PUB00081712], [cite:PUB00081711]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR043603	Phlebovirus glycoprotein G2, C-terminal domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;HRTV is an insect-borne virus found in America that can infect humans. It belongs to the newly defined family Phenuiviridae, order Bunyavirales. HRTV contains three single-stranded RNA segments (L, M, and S). The M segment of the virus encodes a polyprotein precursor that is cleaved into two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Gc is a fusion protein facilitating virus entry into host cells [[cite:PUB00094395]]. G2 (also known as Gc) is necessary for optimal glycoprotein G1 (also found as Gn) expression and efficient production or viral-like particles and possibly for the cell infection, as G2 is determinant for cell fusion [[cite:PUB00094392]]. Phleboviral G2 fusion glycoprotein is both functionally and structurally analogous to the fusion glycoproteins of alphaviruses and flaviviruses, all of them recognize DC-SIGN receptor to enable viral attachment [[cite:PUB00094395]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This domain is found at the C-terminal of several Phlebovirus glycoprotein G2 sequences. Two prefusion conformation structures of bunyavirus Gc from RVFV in the Phenuiviridae family [[cite:PUB00094421]] and Hantaan virus (HTNV) in the Hantaviridae family [[cite:PUB00094420]] have been solved. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR043612	Coronavirus replicase NSP4, N-terminal	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This is the N-terminal domain of the coronavirus NSP4 which represents the membrane spanning region, covering four transmembrane regions [[cite:PUB00094132]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4/nsp4) is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein in coronaviruses (CoVs). It is a membrane-spanning protein which is thought to anchor the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) to modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes which forms double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) or convoluted membranes (CMs). NSP4 is required for RTC formation [[cite:PUB00094132]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR043613	Non-structural protein 2, C-terminal domain, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. The function of NSP2 is uncertain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This domain is found at the C-terminal of NSP2 in alpha and betacoronaviruses. It is found in two copies in some viral NSP2 proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR043615	Nonstructural protein 2, N-terminal domain, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found at the N-terminal of NSP2. This region contains numerous conserved and semi-conserved cysteine residues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coronavirus non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. The function of NSP2 is uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR043636	L1 transposable element, RRM domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain represents a conserved component in the protein ORF1 of the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposon. This domain is designated RRM, which stands for RNA recognition motif, and is involved in RNA binding. Cooperation between this RRM domain and the C-terminal domain is required to achieve this, despite the fact that these two domains do not contact each other [[cite:PUB00056309], [cite:PUB00050061]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044067	Picornavirales 3C/3C-like protease domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Viruses in the order Picornavirales infect different vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant hosts and are responsible for a variety of human, animal, and plant diseases. These viruses have a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome that generally translates a large precursor polyprotein which is proteolytically cleaved after translation to generate mature functional viral proteins. This process is usually mediated by (more than one) proteases, and a 3C (for the family Picornaviridae) or 3C-like (3CL) protease (for other families) plays a central role in the cleavage of the viral precursor polyprotein. In addition to this key role, 3C/3C-like protease is able to cleave a number of host proteins to remodel the cellular environment for virus reproduction [[cite:PUB00032759], [cite:PUB00094816], [cite:PUB00050441], [cite:PUB00056357], [cite:PUB00056400], [cite:PUB00094817]]. The Picornavirales 3C/3C-like protease domain forms the MEROPS peptidase family C3 (picornain family) of clan PA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3C/3CL protease domain adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold with a cysteine nucleophile in place of a commonly found serine which suggests that the cysteine and serine perform an analogous catalytic function. The catalytic triad is made of a histidine, an aspartate/glutamate and the conserved cysteine in this sequential order. The 3C/3CL protease domain folds into two antiparallel beta barrels that are linked by a loop with a short alpha-helix in its middle, and flanked by two other alpha-helices at the N- and C-terminal. The two barrels are topologically equivalent and are formed by six antiparallel beta strands with the first four organised into a Greek key motif. The active-site residues are located in the cleft between the two barrels with the nucleophilic Cys from the C-terminal barrel and the general acid base His-Glu/Asp from the N-terminal barrel [[cite:PUB00032759], [cite:PUB00094816], [cite:PUB00056357]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044336	SF1 helicase, zinc-binding domain, tornidovirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the Cys/His rich zinc-binding domain (ZBD) of SF1 helicase from tornidovirus which includes White bream virus (WBV). This domain has 3 zinc-finger motifs [[cite:PUB00095905]]. This group of viruses belong to Nidovirales order and it shares the same genome organisation. It encodes the large polyprotein pp1a which is then proteolytically processed to produce the enzymes required for the replicative machinery. This is a novel cluster of nidoviruses that significantly diverged from toroviruses and, even more, from coronaviruses, roniviruses, and arteriviruses [[cite:PUB00095905]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044343	Nonstructural protein 13, 1B domain, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Helicase nonstructural protein 13 (NSP13) is encoded by the replicase polyprotein 1a/ab of coronaviruses and released after a proteolytic process. It plays a vital role in catalysing the unwinding of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands in an NTP-dependent manner. It is a multidomain protein which includes an N-terminal Cys/His rich zinc-binding domain (ZBD) and a helicase core that belongs to the superfamily SF1 of helicases. The helicase core contains two RecA1 and RecA2 domains and a domain 1B [[cite:PUB00095900]]. There is a stalk region which connects the ZBD domain and 1B domain. Nsp13 adopts a triangular pyramid shape in which the two RecA1 and A2 and 1B domain form the triangular base, while N-terminal ZBD and stalk domains are arranged at the apex of the pyramid [[cite:PUB00095921], [cite:PUB00095922]]. Recently, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 as an interferon antagonist. It is involved in type I interferon (IFN-I) response as it binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation to inhibit interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) which results in decreased IRF3 activation [[cite:PUB00096706], [cite:PUB00096708]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the 1B domain, which has a regulatory role modulating the nucleic acid substrate binding. Based on the structures from the related Equine arteritis virus (EAV) NSP10, it is likely that 1B domain forms a channel together with 1A and 2A domains that accommodates the single stranded nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00095900], [cite:PUB00095904]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044348	Nonstructural protein 10, 1B domain, arterivirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Nidoviruses (Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae) feature the most complex genetic organization among plus-strand RNA viruses. Their replicase genes encode an exceptionally large replicase polyprotein 1a/ab which is then proteolytically processed to release different nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that mediate the key functions required for replication and transcription. One of these NSPs, called NSP10 in arteriviruses (Av) and NSP13 in coronaviruses (CoV) functions as a helicase [[cite:PUB00095900], [cite:PUB00084255]]. It is a multidomain protein consisting of a N-terminal Cys/His rich zinc-binding domain (ZBD) and a helicase core that belongs to the superfamily SF1 of helicases. The helicase core contains two RecA1 and RecA2 domains and a 1B domain [[cite:PUB00095900]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; This entry represents the 1B domain, which has a regulatory role modulating the nucleic acid substrate binding. Based on the structures from the Equine arteritis virus (EAV) NSP10, 1B domain undergoes large conformational change upon substrate binding, and forms a channel together with 1A and 2A domains that accommodates the single stranded nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00095900], [cite:PUB00095904]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044355	SF1 helicase, uncharacterised linker domain, tornidovirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents an uncharacterised domain found in SF1 helicases from tornidovirus, including Breda virus serotype 1. This group of viruses belong to Nidovirales order and it shares the same genome organisation. It encodes the large polyprotein pp1a which is then proteolytically processed to produce the enzymes required for the replicative machinery. This is a novel cluster of nidoviruses that significantly diverged from toroviruses and, even more, from coronaviruses, roniviruses, and arteriviruses [[cite:PUB00095905]]. This domain connects the zinc-binding domain (ZBD) with the first helicase domain, resembling that of the 1B domain in SARS-Nsp13 helicase [[cite:PUB00095905], [cite:PUB00094087]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044401	NSP15, NendoU domain, coronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the C-terminal NendoU domain of NSP15. NSP15 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. This domain exhibits endoribonuclease activity designated EndoU, highly conserved in all known CoVs and is part of the replicase-transcriptase complex that plays important roles in virus replication and transcription [[cite:PUB00041172], [cite:PUB00094083], [cite:PUB00094089]]. NSP15 is a Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves the 5'-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA either upstream or downstream of uridylates, at GUU or GU to produce molecules with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate ends [[cite:PUB00094083], [cite:PUB00094413], [cite:PUB00094089]]. PUN RNA is a CoV MDA5-dependent  pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) [[cite:PUB00094089]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nidovirus endoribonucleases (NendoUs) are uridylate-specific endoribonucleases, which release a cleavage product containing a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate at the 3' terminal end. They are conserved among this order and a genetic marker of nidoviruses [[cite:PUB00094084], [cite:PUB00095870], [cite:PUB00095889]]. A feature of these viruses' evolutionary relationship is the organisation and processing of the genome, which is translated in two large precursor polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) from the replicase gene, that are proteolytically processed by virus proteases into 13 to 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) [[cite:PUB00094084]]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proteins containing the NendoU domain include NSP15 from coronaviruses and NSP11 from arteriviruses, both of which participate in the viral replication process and in the evasion of the host immune system. Although they are similar and conserved, they only share 27% identical residues and show structural differences [[cite:PUB00095870]]. NSP11 has an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal NendoU catalytic domain. NSP11 functions as a dimer and Mg2 is dispensable for its activity. In Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), NSP11 induces STAT2 degradation to inhibit interferon signaling. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the amino acid residue K59 located at the N-terminal domain of NSP11 is indispensable for inducing STAT2 reduction [[cite:PUB00095875]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044730	Ribonuclease H-like domain, plant type	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The RNase H domain is responsible for hydrolysis of the RNA portion of RNA x DNA hybrids,  and this activity requires the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+) that bind its active  site. This domain is a part of a large family of homologous RNase H enzymes of which the RNase HI protein from Escherichia coli is the best characterised [[cite:PUB00006422], [cite:PUB00079405], [cite:PUB00025090]]. Secondary structure predictions for the enzymes from E. coli, yeast, human liver and diverse retroviruses (such as Rous sarcoma virus and the Foamy viruses) supported, in every case, the five beta-strands (1 to 5) and four or five alpha-helices (A, B/C, D, E) that have been identified by crystallography in the RNase H domain of Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase and in E. coli RNase H [[cite:PUB00006461]]. Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a modular enzyme carrying polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities in separable domains. Reverse transcriptase (RT) converts the single-stranded RNA genome of a retrovirus into a double-stranded DNA copy for integration into the host genome. This process requires ribonuclease H as well as RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Retroviral RNase H is synthesised as part of the POL polyprotein that contains; an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. Bacterial RNase H [intenz:3.1.26.4] catalyses endonucleolytic cleavage to 5'-phosphomonoester acting on RNA-DNA hybrids. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The  3D structure of the RNase H domain from diverse bacteria and retroviruses has  been  solved [[cite:PUB00015351], [cite:PUB00015352], [cite:PUB00015353], [cite:PUB00042692]]. All have four beta strands  and four to five alpha helices. The E. coli RNase H1 protein binds a single Mg2+ ion cofactor in the  active site of the enzyme. The divalent cation is bound by the carboxyl groups of four acidic residues, Asp-10, Glu-48, Asp-70, and Asp-134 [[cite:PUB00015352]]. The first three acidic residues are highly conserved in all bacterial and retroviral RNase H sequences.&lt;/p&gt; This domain is found predominantly in plants, including the putative ribonuclease H protein At1g65750 from Arabidopsis.
IPR044863	Nidovirus  RdRp-associated nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses that belong to the order Nidovirales infect a wide range of vertebrates (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) or invertebrates (Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae). Examples of nidoviruses with high economic and societal impact are the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and the zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. In all nidoviruses, at least two-thirds of the capacity of the polycistronic genome is occupied by the two large open reading frames (ORFs; 1a and 1b) that together constitute the replicase gene. The two polyproteins produced, pp1a (ORF1a-encoded) and pp1ab (ORF1a/ORF1b-encoded), are processed to a dozen or more proteins by the virus main protease (3CLpro, encoded in ORF1a) with possible involvement of other protease(s). These and other proteins form a membrane-bound replication-transcription complex (RTC) that invariably includes two key ORF1b-encoded subunits: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a superfamily 1 helicase domain (HEL1), which is fused with a multinuclear Zn-binding domain (ZBD). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of nidoviruses resides in a cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein named non- structural protein (nsp) 12 in coronaviruses and nsp9 in arteriviruses. In all nidoviruses, the C-terminal RdRp domain is linked to a conserved N-terminal domain, which has been coined NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl transferase). The NiRAN domain has an essential nucleotidylation activity and its potential functions in nidovirus replication may include RNA ligation, protein-primed RNA synthesis, and the guanylyl-transferase function that is necessary for mRNA capping [[cite:PUB00097523], [cite:PUB00097522], [cite:PUB00094093], [cite:PUB00097521], [cite:PUB00097520]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The NiRAN domain is characterised by an alpha + beta fold composed of eight alpha helices and a five stranded beta-sheet. In addition, an N-terminal beta-hairpin interacts with the palm subdomain of the RdRp domain [[cite:PUB00097520], [cite:PUB00095923]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044864	Non-structural protein NSP3, SUD-N (Mac2) domain, betacoronavirus	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;SUD consists of three globular domains separated by short linker peptide segments: SUD-N, SUD-M, and SUD-C [[cite:PUB00062522]]. Among these, SUD-N and SUD-M are macrodomains. The SUD-N domain is a related macrodomain which also binds G-quadruplexes [[cite:PUB00050012]]. While SUD-N is specific to the NSP3 of SARS and betacoronaviruses of the sarbecovirus subgenera (B lineage), SUD-M is present in most NSP3 proteins except the NSP3 from betacoronaviruses of the embecovirus subgenera (A lineage). SUD-M, despite its name, is not specific to SARS. SUD-C adopts a frataxin-like fold, has structural similarity to DNA-binding domains of DNA-modifying enzymes, binds single-stranded RNA, and regulates the RNA binding behavior of the SUD-M macrodomain. SARS-CoV Nsp3 contains a third macrodomain (the X-domain). The X-domain may function as a module binding poly(ADP-ribose); however, SUD-N and SUD-M do not bind ADP-ribose, as the triple glycine sequence involved in its binding is not conserved in these [[cite:PUB00094069]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents the N-terminal region of the SUD domain (SUD-N or Mac2) found in non-structural protein NSP3, the product of ORF1a in group 2 (beta) coronaviruses. It is found in human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein 1a and 1ab, and in related coronavirus polyproteins [[cite:PUB00056024]].&lt;/p&gt; Nsp3c-N and Nsp3c-M each display a typical alpha/beta/alpha Macro domain fold, in spite of the complete absence of sequence similarities. The central beta sheet with six beta strands in the order beta1-beta6-beta5-beta2-beta4-beta3 is flanked by two (or three) helices on either side. Only the last strand, beta3, is antiparallel to the other strands. Currently, most known functions of Nsp3c-N/M are connected with RNA binding. All the residues important for binding ADP-ribose and for de-MARylation/de-PARylation activity are not conserved in Nsp3c-N/M; therefore Nsp3c-N/M cannot bind ADP-ribose. Both Nsp3c-N and Nsp3c-M domains bind unusual nucleic acid structures formed by consecutives guanosine nucleotides, where four strands of nucleic acid are forming a superhelix (so-called G-quadruplexes) [[cite:PUB00050012], [cite:PUB00048150], [cite:PUB00062522], [cite:PUB00095930], [cite:PUB00094069]].
IPR045345	Retroviral nucleocapsid Gag protein p24, C-terminal domain	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Gag protein from retroviruses, also known as p24, forms the inner protein layer of the nucleocapsid. It is composed of two domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD), which contributes to viral core formation, and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which is required for capsid dimerisation, Gag oligomerization and viral formation [[cite:PUB00011708], [cite:PUB00011710]]. This protein performs highly complex orchestrated tasks during the assembly, budding, maturation and infection stages of the viral replication cycle. During viral assembly, the proteins form membrane associations and self-associations that ultimately result in budding of an immature virion from the infected cell. Gag precursors also function during viral assembly to selectively bind and package two plus strands of genomic RNA. ELISA tests for p24 is the most commonly used method to demonstrate virus replication both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; [[cite:PUB00003583], [cite:PUB00098654]].&lt;/p&gt; This is the C-terminal domain of retroviral p24 nucleocapsid protein, which contains a highly conserved region across retroviruses, the major homology region (MHR). The MHR is essential for the stability and folding of the monomer and hence for viral assembly, maturation and infectivity. This is a globular domain, composed of four helices and an extended N-terminal strand that forms a dimer through parallel packing of helix 2. The MHR dimer is a target for the development of anti-HIV drugs [[cite:PUB00011708], [cite:PUB00098655], [cite:PUB00042241]].
IPR045358	Ty3 transposon capsid-like protein	interpro7_domain	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry corresponds to the capsid protein found in the Ty3 transposons of yeast as well as other transposable elements present in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00098738], [cite:PUB00098739]]. These long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons share similarities with the envelope protein in retroviruses like HIV-1 [[cite:PUB00098740]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR000012	Retroviral VpR/VpX protein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the human retrovirus associated with AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), and SIV its simian counterpart. Three main groups of primate lentivirus are known, designated Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Human immunodeficiency virus 2 (HIV-2)/Simian immunodeficiency virus - mac (SIVMAC)/Simian immunodeficiency virus - sm (SIVSM) and Simian immunodeficiency virus - agm (SIVAGM). Simian immunodeficiency virus - mnd (SIVMND) has been suggested to represent a fourth distinct group [[cite:PUB00004048]]. These groups are believed to have diverged from a common ancestor long before the spread of AIDS in humans. Genetic variation in HIV-1 and HIV-2 has been studied extensively, and the nucleotide sequences reported for several strains [[cite:PUB00000018]].&lt;p&gt; ORF analysis has revealed two open reading frames, yielding the so-called R- and X-ORF proteins, which show a high degree of sequence similarity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vpx plays a role in nuclear translocation of the viral pre-integration complex (PIC) and is thus required for the virus to infect non-dividing cells. Vpr also plays a role in nuclear translocation of the (PIC) and may target specific host proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. It acts by associating with the cellular CUL4A-DDB1 E3 ligase complex through direct interaction with host VPRPB/DCAF-1. This would result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in infected cells, creating a favourable environment for maximizing viral expression and production by rendering the HIV-1 LTR transcription more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000123	RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), msDNA	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The use of an RNA template to produce DNA, for integration into the host  genome and exploitation of a host cell, is a strategy employed in the replication of retroid elements, such as the retroviruses and bacterial retrons. The enzyme catalysing polymerisation is an RNA-directed DNA-polymerase, or reverse trancriptase (RT) ([intenz:2.7.7.49]). Reverse transcriptase occurs in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses. The enzymatic reaction leads to the production of a unique RNA-DNA complex called msDNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA) in which a single-stranded DNA branches out from an RNA molecule via a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage [[cite:PUB00006269]].\r\n&lt;p&gt;Retroviral reverse transcriptase is synthesised as part of the POL polyprotein that contains; an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. The discovery of retroelements in the prokaryotes raises intriguing questions concerning their roles in bacteria and the origin and evolution of reverse transcriptases and whether the bacterial reverse transcriptases are older than eukaryotic reverse transcriptases [[cite:PUB00006358]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
IPR000696	Peptidase A6, nodavirus coat protein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Aspartic peptidases, also known as aspartyl proteases ([intenz:3.4.23.-]), are widely distributed proteolytic enzymes [[cite:PUB00001330], [cite:PUB00000093], [cite:PUB00000349]] known to exist in vertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, retroviruses and some plant viruses. All known aspartic peptidases are endopeptidases.  A water molecule, activated by two aspartic acid residues, acts as the nucleophile in catalysis.  Aspartic peptidases can be grouped into five clans, each of which shows a unique structural fold [[cite:PUB00000522]].\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peptidases in clan AA are either bilobed (family A1 or the pepsin family) or are a homodimer (all other families in the clan, including retropepsin from HIV-1/AIDS) [[cite:PUB00042504]].  Each lobe consists of a single domain with a closed beta-barrel and each lobe contributes one Asp to form the active site.  Most peptidases in the clan are inhibited by the naturally occurring small-molecule inhibitor pepstatin [[cite:PUB00076784]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AC contains the single family A8: the signal peptidase 2 family.  Members of the family are found in all bacteria.  Signal peptidase 2 processes the premurein precursor, removing the signal peptide.  The peptidase has four transmembrane domains and the active site is on the periplasmic side of the cell membrane.  Cleavage occurs on the amino side of a cysteine where the thiol group has been substituted by a diacylglyceryl group.  Site-directed mutagenesis has identified two essential aspartic acid residues which occur in the motifs GNXXDRX and FNXAD (where X is a hydrophobic residue) [[cite:PUB00076785]].  No tertiary structures have been solved for any member of the family, but because of the intramembrane location, the structure is assumed not to be pepsin-like.&lt;/li&gt; \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AD contains two families of transmembrane endopeptidases: A22 and A24.  These are also known as \"GXGD peptidases\" because of a common GXGD motif which includes one of the pair of catalytic aspartic acid residues.  Structures are known for members of both families and show a unique, common fold with up to nine transmembrane regions [[cite:PUB00066803]].  The active site aspartic acids are located within a large cavity in the membrane into which water can gain access [[cite:PUB00065205]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AE contains two families, A25 and A31.  Tertiary structures have been solved for members of both families and show a common fold consisting of an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich, in which the beta sheet is five stranded [[cite:PUB00011023], [cite:PUB00021296]].&lt;/li&gt;  \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AF contains the single family A26.  Members of the clan are membrane-proteins with a unique fold.  Homologues are known only from bacteria.  The structure of omptin (also known as OmpT) shows a cylindrical barrel containing ten beta strands inserted in the membrane with the active site residues on the outer surface [[cite:PUB00011707]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;There are two families of aspartic peptidases for which neither structure nor active site residues are known and these are not assigned to clans.   Family A5 includes thermopsin, an endopeptidase found only in thermophilic archaea.  Family A36 contains sporulation factor SpoIIGA, which is known to process and activate sigma factor E, one of the transcription factors that controls sporulation in bacteria [[cite:PUB00076786]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This group of proteins, which include the Nodavirus coat precusor endopeptidases, are aspartic peptidases that belong to the MEROPS peptidase family A6 (clan AB).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nodaviruses are small, icosahedral viruses, pathogenic to insects and mammals. A virus particle consists of a single virion, within which is packaged two RNA stands, RNA1 and RNA2.Nodavirus coat precursor endopeptidase (also known as protein alpha) is the only protein encoded by RNA2. During the process of virion assembly, this precursor is cleaved into coat proteins beta and gamma. RNA1 encodes two proteins, at least one of which is involved in RNA replication. The relatively uncomplicated nature of their structural protein and RNA constituents make the nodaviruses a good virus model [[cite:PUB00003260]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The 3D structure of the capsid protein has been determined by X-ray\r\ncrystallography to 2.8A resolution [[cite:PUB00003260]]. The structure contains a beta-barrel\r\ndomain, with a prominent protrusion composed largely of beta-sheet. This\r\nprotrusion, together with similar protrusions from neighbouring subunits,\r\nforms a prominent trigonal pyramid with quasi-3-fold symmetry [[cite:PUB00003260]]. Two\r\nalpha-helices extend toward the interior of the particle [[cite:PUB00003260]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001207	Transposase, mutator type	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Autonomous mobile genetic elements such as transposon or insertion sequences (IS) encode an enzyme, transposase, that is required for excising and inserting\r\nthe mobile element. Transposases have been grouped into various families [[cite:PUB00004452], [cite:PUB00003820], [cite:PUB00001812]]. The mutator family of transposases consists of a number of elements that include, mutator from maize, IsT2 from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Is256 from Staphylococcus aureus, Is1201 from Lactobacillus helveticus, Is1081 from Mycobacterium bovis, IsRm3 from Rhizobium meliloti\r\nand others.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001213	Mouse mammary tumour virus superantigen	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a milk-transmitted type B retrovirus. The superantigen (SAg) is encoded in the long terminal repeat [[cite:PUB00000111]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001361	Gp90 envelope polyprotein of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV)	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Equine infectious anemia virus(EIAV) belongs to the family retroviridae. EIAV gp90 is \r\nhypervariable in the carboxyl-end region and more stable in the amino-end region. This \r\nvariability is a pathogenicity factor that allows the evasion of the host's immune \r\nresponse [[cite:PUB00003494]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001592	Potyvirus coat protein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This protease is found in genome polyproteins of potyviruses. The genome polyprotein contains: N-terminal protein (P1), helper component protease\r\n([intenz:3.4.22], HC-PRO),  protein P3, 6KD protein (6K1), cytoplasmic inclusion protein (CI), 6KD protein 2 (6K2), genome-linked protein (VPG), nuclear inclusion protein A ([intenz:3.4.22]), nuclear inclusion protein B  ([intenz:2.7.7.48]) and coat protein (CP).\r\nThe coat protein is at the C terminus of the polyprotein.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001888	Transposase, type 1	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Autonomous mobile genetic elements such as transposon or insertion sequences (IS) encode an enzyme, transposase, that is required for excising and inserting\r\nthe mobile element. Transposases have been grouped into various families [[cite:PUB00004452], [cite:PUB00003820], [cite:PUB00001812]]. This family includes the mariner transposase [[cite:PUB00001294]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR001958	Tetracycline resistance protein TetA/multidrug resistance protein MdtG	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The tetracycline resistance protein Tet(A) is a tetracycline efflux protein that functions as a metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter [[cite:PUB00035987], [cite:PUB00035988]]. This is an energy-dependent process that decreases the accumulation of the antibiotic in whole cells. Tet(A) is encoded by the transposon Tn10, and is an integral membrane protein with twelve potential transmembrane domains. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that a negative charge at position 66 is essential for tetracycline transport [[cite:PUB00006063]], and that the region that includes the dipeptide plays an important role in metal-tetracycline transport; it perhaps acts as a gate that opens on the charge-charge interaction between Asp66 and the metal-tetracycline.The histidine at position 257 plays an essential role in H+ translocation [[cite:PUB00070990]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both TetA and MdtG belong to major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the largest and most diverse superfamily of secondary active transporters [[cite:PUB00071559]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multidrug resistance protein MdtG is found in enterobacteria and confers resistance to fosfomycin and deoxycholate [[cite:PUB00053912]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002514	Transposase IS3/IS911family	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposase proteins are necessary for efficient DNA transposition.\r\nThis family consists of various Escherichia coli insertion elements and other bacterial transposases some of which are members of the IS3 family. This region includes a helix-turn-helix motif (HTH) at the N terminus followed by a leucine zipper (LZ) motif.  The LZ motif has been shown\r\nto mediate oligomerisation of the transposase components in IS911 [[cite:PUB00006157]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR002662	Birnavirus VP2 protein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), a birnavirus, is an important pathogen in fish farms. Analyses of viral proteins showed that VP2 is the major structural and immunogenic polypeptide of the virus [[cite:PUB00005611], [cite:PUB00043618]]. All neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are specific to VP2 and bind to continuous or discontinuous epitopes. The variable domain of VP2 and the 20 adjacent amino acids of the conserved C-terminal are probably the most important in inducing an immune response for the protection of animals [[cite:PUB00005611]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The large RNA segment of the Birnaviridae codes for a polyprotein (N-VP2-VP4-VP3-C), most of which is then processed to generate the constituent polypeptides. VP4 protein is involved in generating VP2 and VP3 [[cite:PUB00003481]]. Recombinant VP3 is more immunogenic than recombinant VP2 [[cite:PUB00043619]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR003138	Picornavirus coat protein VP4	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Picornaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses. Processing of the viral polyprotein by picornains 3C and 2A generates capsid proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, but VP0 undergoes an autolytic cleavage during virion assembly to generate capsid proteins VP2 and VP4 [[cite:PUB00054231]]. The autolytic cleavage was originally thought to be the action of a serine-type peptidase, but from analogy with the similar autoproteolytic cleavages that are known for capsid proteins from nodaviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N1), tetraviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N2), picobirnaviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N5) and reoviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N7), it is more likely that VP0 is an asparagine-type peptidase; autocatalytic cleavage being promoted by cyclization of a conserved asparagine. &lt;/p&gt;.
IPR003182	RNA2 polyprotein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; RNA2 is a polyprotein movement protein: transports viral genome to neighbouring plant cells directly through plasmosdesmata, without any budding. The movement protein allows efficient cell to cell propagation, by bypassing the host cell wall barrier. It acts by forming a tubular structure at the host plasmodesmata, enlarging it enough to allow free passage of virion capsids [[cite:PUB00066849], [cite:PUB00066850], [cite:PUB00066851]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR003346	Transposase, IS116/IS110/IS902	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposases are needed for efficient transposition of the insertion sequence or transposon DNA.

It is often found with the transposase IS111A/IS1328/IS1533 family (see [interpro:IPR002525]) [[cite:PUB00034637], [cite:PUB00034638]].&lt;/p&gt;

The calicivirus genome contains two open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2 [[cite:PUB00003528], [cite:PUB00003519]]. ORF1 encodes a non-structural polypeptide, which has RNA helicase, cysteine protease and RNA polymerase activity. The cysteine peptidases of the Calciviruses belong to MEROPS peptidase  families C3 (subfamilies A to G), C24, C28, C37 and C40. The regions of the poly-protein in which these activities lie are similar to proteins produced by the picornaviruses [[cite:PUB00003528], [cite:PUB00001630]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR004252	Probable transposase, Ptta/En/Spm, plant	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposase proteins are necessary for efficient DNA transposition. This family includes various probable plant transposases from the Ptta and En/Spm families [[cite:PUB00034639], [cite:PUB00066989]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004312	Arabidopsis retrotransposon Orf1	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;ATHILA is a group of Arabidopsis thaliana retrotransposons [[cite:PUB00007486]] belonging to the Ty3/gypsy family of the long terminal\r\n  repeat (LTR) class of eukaryotic retrotransposons[[cite:PUB00007487], [cite:PUB00007488]]. The central region of ATHILA retrotransposons contains two or\r\n  three open reading frames (ORFs). This family represents the ORF1 product. The function of ORF1 is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004337	Capsid, astroviral	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The astrovirus genome is apparently organised with nonstructural proteins encoded  at the 5' end and structural proteins at the 3' end [[cite:PUB00007525]]. \r\nProteins in this family are encoded by astrovirus ORF2, one of the three astrovirus ORFs (1a, 1b, 2). The proteins contain a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motif [[cite:PUB00007525]]. The 87kDa precursor polyprotein\r\n  undergoes an intracellular cleavage to form a 79kDa protein. Subsequently, extracellular trypsin cleavage yields the three\r\n  proteins forming the infectious virion [[cite:PUB00007526]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR004957	Gag polyprotein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Gag polyprotein is a core viral polyprotein that undergoes specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo to yield the mature protein. It is involved in capsid formation and genome binding. Shortly after infection, interaction between incoming particle-associated Gag proteins and host dynein allows centrosomal targeting of the viral genome (associated to Gag), prior to nucleus translocation and integration into host genome [[cite:PUB00068239], [cite:PUB00068240]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005021	Terminase large subunit, Lambdalikevirus-type	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Terminase large subunit (TerL) from bacteriophages and evolutionarily related viruses, is an important component of the DNA packing machinery and comprises an ATPase domain, which powers DNA translocation and a nuclease domain that cuts concatemeric DNA [[cite:PUB00082566], [cite:PUB00098421], [cite:PUB00098422]]. TerL forms pentamers in which the ATPase domains form a ring distal to the capsid.  The ATPase domain contains a C-terminal subdomain that sits above the ATPase active site, called the \"Lid subdomain\" with reference to analogous lid subdomains found in other ATPases [[cite:PUB00098422]]. It contains a hydrophobic patch (Trp and Tyr residues) that mediates critical interactions in the interface between adjacent ATPase subunits and assists the positioning of the arginine finger residue that catalyses ATP hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00098422]]. The endonuclease cuts concatemeric DNA first in the initiation phase in a sequence specific site and later in the completion stage of the DNA packaging process when the capsid is full [[cite:PUB00098421], [cite:PUB00098422]]. Cryo-EM studies indicate that TerL forms a pentamer that binds to a dodecameric assembly called portal and attaches to the capsid. It has been proposed that nuclease domains form a radially arranged ring that is proximal to portal, playing a key role in pentamer assembly [[cite:PUB00098422]]. The nuclease domain has a RNAse H-like fold and it has been proposed to utilise a two-metal catalysis mechanism like in other RNAse H-like endonucleases such as RNase H, transposases, retroviral integrases and RuvC Holliday junction resolvases [[cite:PUB00098421]]. This entry also includes uncharacterised bacterial sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR005063	Transposase, IS1	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposase proteins are necessary for efficient DNA transposition. This family represents bacterial IS1 transposases [[cite:PUB00034641]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR006518	Trypanosome RHS	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;These sequences are full-length and part-length members of the RHS (retrotransposon hot spot) family in Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi. Members of this family are frequently interrupted by non-LTR retrotransposons inserted at exactly the same relative position [[cite:PUB00020247]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR006783	Transposase, ISC1217	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Autonomous mobile genetic elements such as transposon or insertion sequences (IS) encode an enzyme, transposase, that is required for excising and inserting\r\nthe mobile element. Transposases have been grouped into various families [[cite:PUB00004452], [cite:PUB00003820], [cite:PUB00001812]]. This family includes the putative transposase ISC1217 from archaebacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR007069	Transposase, IS801/IS1294	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposases are needed for efficient transposition of the insertion  sequence or transposon DNA. This family includes transposases IS1294 and  IS801 [[cite:PUB00034643]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR007289	Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus, Vpu	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This short protein has no known function and is found in Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the etiological agent of a contagious lung tumour of sheep known as sheep pulmonary adenomatosis. JSRV exhibits a simple genetic organisation, characteristic of the type D and type B retroviruses, with the canonical retroviral sequences gag, pro, pol and env encoding the structural proteins of the virion and an additional open reading frame (Vpu/orf-x), of approximately 500 bp overlapping pol [[cite:PUB00010092]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR008042	Retrotransposon, Pao	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This signature identifies members of the Pao retrotransposon family.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR008608	Ectropic viral integration site 2A protein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This family contains several mammalian ectropic viral integration site 2A (EVI2A) proteins. The function of this protein is unknown although it is thought to be a membrane protein and may function as an oncogene in retrovirus induced myeloid tumours [[cite:PUB00011593], [cite:PUB00011594]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR008748	Hepatitis E virus, cysteine peptidase	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the cysteine proteinase of hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is a papain-like protease that cleaves the viral polyprotein encoded by ORF1 of the hepatitis E virus  [[cite:PUB00011628], [cite:PUB00011629], [cite:PUB00011630], [cite:PUB00098818]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.  Cysteine peptidases that are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases are included in clan PB.  Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.  Cysteine peptidases with an intein-like fold are included in clan PD, which also includes asparagine lyases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring.  In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base.  Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan.  Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases.  From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families [[cite:PUB00011704]].  Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole.  Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases.  They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloromercuribenzoate.&lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold.  There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp).  A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a beta-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these.  Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases [[cite:PUB00076953]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold.  Proteins in the clan have an alpha/beta/alpha sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys.  The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues [[cite:PUB00020025]]. Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold.  The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them.  One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a beta barrell.  The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys.  This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold.  Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides.  The fold shows a closed beta barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel [[cite:PUB00030423]].  The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR009379	Structural protein VP1/VP3	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Sulfolobus virus-like particle SSV1 and its fusellovirus homologues can be found in many acidic (pH less than 4.0) hot springs (greater than 70 degrees C) around the world. SSV1 contains a 15.5-kb double-stranded DNA genome that encodes 34 proteins with greater than 50 amino acids [[cite:PUB00014897]]. A site-specific integrase and a DnaA-like protein have been previously identified by sequence homology, and three structural proteins have been isolated from purified virus and identified by N-terminal sequencing (VP1, VP2, and VP3).&lt;/p&gt;
IPR009492	TniQ	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry consists of several bacterial TniQ proteins. TniQ along with TniA and B is involved in the transposition of the mercury-resistance transposon Tn5053 that carries the mer operon. It has been suggested that the tni genes are involved in the dissemination of integrons [[cite:PUB00011500]]. This entry also includes TnsD from E. coli. TnsD is required for Tn7 transposition [[cite:PUB00075407]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR009882	Gypsy	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This family consists of several Gypsy/Env proteins from Drosophila and Ceratitis fruit fly species. Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster. Phylogenetic studies suggest that occasional horizontal transfer events of gypsy occur between Drosophila species. Gypsy possesses infective properties associated with the products of the envelope gene that might be at the origin of these interspecies transfers [[cite:PUB00013063]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR011518	Transposase, Rhodopirellula-type	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;These transposases are found in the planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica, the cyanobacterium Nostoc, and the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR011931	Tyrosine recombinase XerC	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;  The phage integrase family describes a number of recombinases with tyrosine active sites that transiently bind covalently to DNA. Many are associated with mobile DNA elements, including phage, transposons, and phase variation loci. This entry represents XerC, which is closely related to the other chromosomal protein XerD ([interpro:IPR011932]). XerC and XerD are site-specific recombinases which help resolve chromosome dimers to monomers for cell division after DNA replication. XerC and XerD interact with cell division protein FtsK [[cite:PUB00015510]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR011932	Tyrosine recombinase XerD	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Proteins in this entry are part of the wider so-called \"phage\" integrase fmaily which describes a number of recombinases with tyrosine active sites that transiently bind covalently to DNA. Many are associated with mobile DNA elements, including phage, transposons, and phase variation loci.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the chromosomally-encoded polypeptide XerD, which is closely related to, and interacts with, another chromosomally-encoded polypeptide, XerC ([interpro:IPR011931]). These proteins are site-specific tyrosine recombinases, which act by catalyzing the cutting and rejoining of the recombining DNA molecules [[cite:PUB00015510]]. They form a cyclic heterotetrameric complex composed of two molecules of XerC and two molecules of XerD. The XerC-XerD complex is essential to convert dimers of the bacterial chromosome into monomers to permit their segregation at cell division. It also contributes to the segregational stability of plasmids.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;XerD is composed of two domains, an N-terminal alpha-helical domain, and a C-terminal domain composed mostly of alpha helices, with a three-stranded antiprallel beta sheet along one edge [[cite:PUB00020091]]. The active site is found at the extreme C-terminal end of the polypeptide. Most of the C-terminal domain is structurally homologous to that of other \"phage\" integrases, but the active site regions of these enzymes are stucturally distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR011946	Integrase, integron-type	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;  Members of this family are integrases associated with integrons (and super-integrons), which are systems for incorporating and expressing cassettes of laterally transferred DNA. Incorporation occurs at an attI site. A super-integron, as in Vibrio species, may include over 100 cassettes. This family belongs to the phage integrase family that also includes recombinases XerC ([interpro:IPR011931]) and XerD ([interpro:IPR011932]), which are bacterial housekeeping proteins. Within this family of integron integrases, some are designated by class, e.g. IntI4, a class 4 integron integrase from Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar eltor str. N16961.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR012014	Retroelement-encoded protein, env-related	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Members of this group are encoded by LTR-retrotransposons and have sequence similarity to env genes of retroviruses [[cite:PUB00014661]]. ZAM and Idefix are two LTR-retrotransposons from Drosophila melanogaster and are similar in structure to vertebrate retroviruses. In most strains where the distribution has been studied, ZAM appears to be present exclusively in the intercalary heterochromatin, while Idefix copies are mainly found in the centromeric heterochromatin with very few copies in euchromatin [[cite:PUB00014663]]. However, ZAM and Idefix have been noted to accumulate at a defined site in the D. melanogaster RevI strain [[cite:PUB00014661], [cite:PUB00014660]]. Like ZAM, Idefix displays the structural features of a vertebrate retrovirus. Its three open reading frames encode predicted products resembling the products of the gag, pol, and env genes of retroviruses [[cite:PUB00014661], [cite:PUB00014662]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR012379	LytTR MHYE transcriptional regulator, putative	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Members of this group combine the LytTR DNA-binding transcriptional regulator domain [[cite:PUB00009981]] with an N-terminal membrane-bound MHYE domain that consists of three predicted transmembrane segments with conserved Glu, Asp, His and Tyr residues. The membrane topology of this domain is somewhat similar to that of MHYT domain [[cite:PUB00016193]], suggesting that it, too, might be membrane-bound and metal-binding [[cite:PUB00009981]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt; A member of this group is RpfD from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. Although the &lt;i&gt;rpfD&lt;/i&gt; gene is located in the &lt;i&gt;rpf&lt;/i&gt; (regulation of pathogenicity factors) locus of X. campestris, mutants with transposon insertion in the &lt;i&gt;rpfD&lt;/i&gt; gene did not exhibit any discernible phenotype [[cite:PUB00015987]]. The function of this protein is not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR012487	Nairovirus M polyprotein-like	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The sequences in this family are similar to the Dugbe virus (Dugbe nairovirus) M polyprotein precursor ([swissprot:Q02004]), which includes glycoproteins G1 and G2. Both are thought to be inserted in the membrane of the Golgi complex of the infected host cell, and G1 is known to have a role in infection of vertebrate hosts [[cite:PUB00016532]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR012915	Reovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lambda 3	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The sequences in this family are similar to the reoviral minor core protein lambda 3 ([swissprot:P17378]), which functions as a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase within the protein capsid. It is organised into 3 domains. The N- and C-terminal domains create a \"cage\" which encloses a conserved central catalytic domain within a hollow centre. This catalytic domain is arranged to form finger, palm and thumb subdomains. Unlike other RNA polymerases, such as HIV reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase, the lambda 3 protein binds template and substrate with only localised rearrangements, and catalytic activity can occur with little structural change. However, the structure of the catalytic complex is similar to that of other polymerase catalytic complexes with known structure [[cite:PUB00016487]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR014412	Genome polyprotein, Flavivirus	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This group represents a genome polyprotein from Flavivirus. The polyprotein is cleaved by peptidases (including the NS3 protein, a serine endopeptidase [[cite:PUB00088375]]) into 14 chains, including the RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5 or non-structural protein 5, with three activities: mRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase ([intenz:2.1.1.56]), mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase  ([intenz:2.1.1.57]) and RNA-directed RNA polymerase ([intenz:2.7.7.48]).&lt;/p&gt;
IPR014413	M polyprotein precursor, Orthobunyavirus type	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This group represents a M polyprotein precursor, Orthobunyavirus type.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR014414	Envelope glycoprotein precursor/M polyprotein precursor, Tospovirus type	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This group represents an envelope glycoprotein precursor/M polyprotein precursor, Tospovirus type.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR014417	Integrase, predicted	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Integrases are site-specific recombinases that catalyse a diverse array of DNA rearrangements. These proteins are putative integrases found in bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR015122	Excisionase from transposon Tn916	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The phage-encoded excisionase protein Tn916-Xis adopts a winged-helix structure that consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet that packs against a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif and a third C-terminal alpha-helix. It is encoded for by Tn916, which also codes for the integrase Tn916-Int. The protein interacts with DNA by the insertion of helix alpha-2 into the major groove and the contact of the hairpin that connects strands beta-2 and beta-3 with the adjacent phosphodiester backbone and/or minor groove. Tn916-Xis stimulates phage excision and inhibits viral integration by stabilising distorted DNA structures [[cite:PUB00032591]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR015820	Ty transposon capsid protein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Ty are yeast transposons. A 5.7kb transcript codes for p3 a fusion protein of TYA and TYB. The TYA protein is analogous to the gag protein of retroviruses. TYA a is cleaved to form 46kd protein which can form mature virion like particles [[cite:PUB00003533]]. This entry corresponds to the capsid protein from Ty1 and Ty2 transposons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeast retrotransposon Ty1 produces its proteins as precursors that are subsequently cleaved by an aspartic protease encoded by the element. Cleavage of the gag and gag-Pol polyprotein precursors is a critical step in proliferation of retroviruses and retroelements. These cleavage events are essential for transposition as they release the active reverse transcriptase and integrase and they modify the structure of the virus-like particles in a way that is analogous to the morphological changes that occur during retrovirus core maturation [[cite:PUB00003533], [cite:PUB00011886], [cite:PUB00011887]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR016402	Envelope glycoprotein precursor, Hantavirus	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The medium (M) genome segment of Hantaviruses encodes the two virion glycoproteins [[cite:PUB00004342]], G1 and G2, as a polyprotein precursor. This entry represents the M polyprotein precursor.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR016404	M polyprotein precursor, phlebovirus	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This group represents the Phlebovirus M polyprotein precursor that contains the nonstructural protein NS-M, glycoprotein G1 and glycoprotein G2. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR018019	Luteovirus Orf2 putative replicase 1	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;ORF2 of Potato leafroll virus (PLrV) encodes a polyprotein which is translated following a -1 frameshift. The polyprotein has a putative linear arrangement of membrane achor-VPg-peptidase-polmerase domains. The serine peptidase domain which is found in this group of sequences belongs to MEROPS peptidase family S39 (clan PA(S)), subfamily S39B. It is likely that the peptidase domain is involved in the cleavage of the polyprotein [[cite:PUB00011866]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The nucleotide sequence for the RNA of PLrV has been determined [[cite:PUB00003126], [cite:PUB00001567]]. The sequence contains six large open reading frames (ORFs). The 5' coding region encodes two polypeptides of 28K and 70K, which overlap in different reading frames; it is suggested that the third ORF in the 5' block is translated by frameshift readthrough near the end of the 70K protein, yielding a 118K polypeptide [[cite:PUB00003126]]. Segments of the predicted amino acid sequences of these ORFs resemble those of known viral RNA polymerases, ATP-binding proteins and viral genome-linked proteins. The nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) has been determined [[cite:PUB00004354]]. The sequence contains six long ORFs. A cluster of three of these ORFs, including the coat protein cistron, display extensive amino acid sequence similarity to corresponding ORFs of a second luteovirus: Barley yellow dwarf virus [[cite:PUB00004354]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR018154	TLV/ENV coat polyprotein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Enveloped viruses such as Human immunodeficiency virus 1, influenza virus, and Ebola virus sp. express a surface glycoprotein that mediates both cell attachment and fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The ENV polyprotein (coat polyprotein) usually contains two coat proteins which differ depending on the source.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The structure of a number of the ENV polyprotein domains have been determined: &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\nThe crystal structure of an extraviral segment of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) transmembrane (TM) subunit has been determined to 1.7-A  resolution. This segment contains a trimeric coiled coil, with a hydrophobic cluster at its base and a strand that packs in an antiparallel orientation against the coiled coil. This structure serves as a model for a wide range of viral fusion proteins; key residues in this structure are conserved among C- and D-type retroviruses and the filovirus ebola [[cite:PUB00027393]].\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\r\nAn essential step in retrovirus infection is the binding of the virus to its receptor on a target cell. The structure of the receptor-binding domain of the envelope glycoprotein from Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) has been determined determined to 2.0-A resolution. The core of the domain is an antiparallel beta sandwich, with two interstrand loops forming a helical subdomain atop the sandwich. The residues in the helical region, but not in the beta sandwich, are highly variable among mammalian C-type retroviruses with distinct tropisms, indicating that the helical subdomain determines the receptor specificity of the virus [[cite:PUB00010668]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
IPR018582	Envelope glycoprotein, lentivirus	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; The proteins in this family are envelope glycoproteins from feline immunodeficiency retrovirus. The process of lentiviral envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion of membranes is essential for viral entry and syncytia formation [[cite:PUB00044248]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR018899	Conjugative transposon, TraO	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This is a family of conjugative transposon proteins. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR019205	Protein of unknown function DUF2080, transposon-encoded	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This entry, found in various hypothetical archaeal proteins, has no known function. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR019679	Regulatory phage protein Cox	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Cox proteins are expressed by Enterobacteria phages. The Cox protein is a 79-residue basic protein with a predicted strong helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. It inhibits integrative recombination and it activates site-specific excision of the HP1 genome from the Haemophilus influenzae chromosome, Hp1. Cox appears to function as a tetramer. Cox binding sites consist of two direct repeats of the consensus motif 5'-GGTMAWWWWA, one Cox tetramer binding to each motif. Cox binding interferes with the interaction of HP1 integrase with one of its binding sites, IBS5. This competition is central to directional control. Both Cox binding sites are needed for full inhibition of integration and for activating excision, because it plays a positive role in assembling the nucleoprotein complexes that produce excisive recombination, by inducing the formation of a critical conformation in those complexes [[cite:PUB00044432]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR020876	Tyrosine recombinase XerD-like	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Phage integrases are enzymes that mediate unidirectional site-specific recombination between two DNA recognition sequences, the phage attachment site, attP, and the bacterial attachment site, attB [[cite:PUB00014061]]. Integrases may be grouped into two major families, the tyrosine recombinases and the serine recombinases, based on their mode of catalysis. Tyrosine family integrases, such as Bacteriophage lambda integrase, utilise a catalytic tyrosine to mediate strand cleavage, tend to recognise longer attP sequences, and require other proteins encoded by the phage or the host bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The recombinases Cre from phage P1, XerD from Escherichia coli and Flp from yeast are members of the tyrosine recombinase family, and have a two-domain motif resembling that of lambda integrase, as well as sharing a conserved binding mechanism [[cite:PUB00014062]]. The structural fold of their catalytic core domains resemble that of Lambda integrase&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This entry contains XerD-like putative tyrosine recombinases from the Streptococcaceae family.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR021502	Protein of unknown function DUF3158	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; Some members in this family of proteins are annotated as integrase regulator R however this cannot be confirmed. This family of proteins with unknown function appear to be restricted to Proteobacteria. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR021672	Protein of unknown function DUF3258	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This viral family are possible phage integrase proteins. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR021767	Transposon Tn21 modulator protein	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;TnpM enhances the Tn21 transposition by activating expression of the transposase gene and decreases the resolution of the cointegrated DNA by suppressing expression of the resolvase gene [[cite:PUB00086411]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR021842	Protein of unknown function DUF3435	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This family of proteins are functionally uncharacterised. This protein is found in eukaryotes.

It has been reported that NS6 can increase the cellular gene synthesis and it can also induce apoptosis through Jun N-terminal kinase and Caspase-3 mediated stress. This protein can modulate host antiviral responses by inhibiting synthesis and signalling of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) via two complementary pathways. One involves NS6 interaction with host N-Myc (and STAT) interactor (Nmi) protein inducing its degradation via ubiquitin proteasome pathway, suppressing Nmi enhanced IFN signalling. The other pathway suppresses the translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and downstream IFN signalling [[cite:PUB00094123]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR038965	Transposase InsF-like	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposase InsF is an integrase for the insertion sequence IS3 in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and other bacteria.  An insertion sequence is the simplest form of transposon (or mobile element) and encodes no more than the transposase and short inverted repeats, the minimum required for its own mobility [[cite:PUB00088613]].  In the case of insertion sequence IS3, there are two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that can produce three proteins of 10, 32 and 42kDa in size.  The 10kDa protein is the product of orfA, InsF is the 32kDa protein and produced from orfB, and the 42kDa protein from both ORFs by -1 translational frameshifting [[cite:PUB00088616]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR040222	ALOG  family	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a group of ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1) domain containing proteins, including LSH1-10 from Arabidopsis and G1/G1L1-8 from rice. G1 may be involved in transcriptional regulation and specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet [[cite:PUB00072583]]. LSH1 is involved in phytochrome-mediated light signaling and in shoot meristem identity [[cite:PUB00090714]]. The expression of LSH3 and LSH4 can be regulated by CUC1, which may suppress organ differentiation in the boundary region [[cite:PUB00090715]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The 125-residue ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and oryza G1) domain is rich in basic\r\namino acids, especially arginine, and is highly conserved among land plants.\r\nMembers of the ALOG family of proteins function as key developmental\r\nregulators. It has been proposed that the ALOG domain originated from the N-\r\nterminal DNA-binding domains of integrases belonging to the tyrosine\r\nrecombinase superfamily encoded by a distinct type of DIRS1-like LTR\r\nretrotransposon found in several eukaryotes.

KDZ transposases are widely present in fungi, metazoa, chlorophytes and haotpohytes.

IPR040910	Closterovirus 1a polyprotein, central region	interpro7_family	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This family represents an alignment of the Zemlya region of closteroviruses. The alignment of the 1a polyprotein of the Closteroviridae family members revealed that this region was not conserved in other genera. The homologs of the Zemlya region are not found in other viral or cellular proteins. This region is named \"the Zemlya region\" (zemlya)- is the Russian word for \"earth\", meaning that its conserved amino acid sequence represents a solid ground within the highly variable central region of 1a polyporotein. It is composed of four predicted alpha-helices, alphaA to alphaD, and contains three conserved positions: i) a strictly conserved glutamate (E) in helix alphaA (E1291 in Beet yellows closterovirus (BYV)); ii) a strictly conserved proline (P1380) in alphaD; and iii) a conserved basic position (arginine or lysine; R1384 in BYV). The presence of a conserved proline in helix alphaD is noteworthy because prolines are strongly disfavoured in helices; this proline most probably induces a kink in the helix. Functional studies have suggested that most part of the Zemlya region, targets the ER and remodels the ER membranes. More specifically, deletion analysis and substitutions of the conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues suggest a role of the putative amphipathic helix1368-1385 (alphaD) in the formation of globules. Hence it was proposed that this specific region in 1a protein protein may be involved in the biogenesis of closterovirus [[cite:PUB00091327]].&lt;/p&gt;

IPR008916	Retrovirus capsid, C-terminal	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; The Gag polyprotein from retroviruses is processed by viral protease to produce the major structural proteins, including the capsid protein.  The newly formed capsid protein rearranges to form the capsid core particle that surrounds the viral genome of the mature virus.  The capsid is composed of two domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD), which contributes to viral core formation, and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which is required for capsid dimerisation, Gag oligomerization and viral formation.  The CTD contains the major homology region (MHR), a stretch of 20 amino acids that is conserved across retroviruses and is essential for viral assembly, maturation and infectivity.  The CTD is composed of a bundle of four helices in an up and down arrangement, where helix 3 is shorter than the others [[cite:PUB00011708], [cite:PUB00011709], [cite:PUB00011710]]. &lt;/p&gt;

IPR009004	Transposase, Mu, C-terminal	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; Transposons are abundant in nature and they play critical roles in pathogenesis, the spread of antibiotic resistance, and genome evolution. Transposition involves cleavage at the 3' ends of the transposon followed by the rejoining of the 3' OH termini to a target DNA. These steps are catalyzed by transposon-encoded transposases, and they occur in the context of higher order protein-DNA complexes called transpososomes. Mu  transpososomes are named according to the chemical steps the Mu ends have undergone. The stable synaptic complex (SSC, or type 0 complex) is the first transpososome detected. Single-strand cleavage at the 3' ends of the Mu sequence then generates the cleaved donor complex (CDC, or type 1 complex). The strand transfer complex (STC, or type II complex) is formed by covalent joining of the Mu 3' ends to the strands of target DNA.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt; The C-terminal end of the MuA protein interacts with the MuB protein that is involved in target DNA site selection and transpososome activation [[cite:PUB00011775]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR010998	Integrase/recombinase, N-terminal	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Phage integrases are enzymes that mediate unidirectional site-specific recombination between two DNA recognition sequences, the phage attachment site, attP, and the bacterial attachment site, attB [[cite:PUB00014061]]. Integrases may be grouped into two major families, the tyrosine recombinases and the serine recombinases, based on their mode of catalysis. Tyrosine family integrases, such as Bacteriophage lambda integrase, utilise a catalytic tyrosine to mediate strand cleavage, tend to recognise longer attP sequences, and require other proteins encoded by the phage or the host bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 356 amino acid lambda integrase consists of two domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD) that includes residues 1 - 64 and is responsible for binding the arm-type sites of attP, and a C-terminal domain that binds the lower affinity core-type sites and contains the catalytic site. The NTD adopts a 4-5 helical bundle fold with two orthogonally packed alpha-hairpins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recombinases Cre from P1 phage, XerD from Escherichia coli, and Flp from yeast are members of the tyrosine recombinase family, and have a two-domain motif resembling that of lambda integrase, as well as sharing a conserved binding mechanism [[cite:PUB00014062], [cite:PUB00034645]].&lt;/p&gt;

Matrix proteins are produced as part of Gag precursor polyproteins. During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved into major structural proteins by the viral protease, yielding the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and some smaller peptides. Gag-derived proteins govern the entire assembly and release of the virus particles, with matrix proteins playing key roles in Gag stability, capsid assembly, transport and budding. Although matrix proteins from different retroviruses appear to perform similar functions and can have similar structural folds which predominantly consist of four closely packed alpha-helices that are interconnected through loops, their primary sequences can be very different [[cite:PUB00055853]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This superfamily represents structurally homologous matrix proteins from different retroviruses, their structure consisting of four-five alpha helices in a right-handed superhelix. Retroviral matrix proteins bearing this structure have been isolated from Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV-cpz), Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Human T-cell leukemia virus 2 (HTLV-2), Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) (Simian Mason-Pfizer virus), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). This entry also identifies matrix proteins from several eukaryotic endogenous retroviruses, which arise when one or more copies of the retroviral genome becomes integrated into the host genome [[cite:PUB00016320]].&lt;/p&gt;

The CTD can be further divided into the core-type binding domain (residues 65-169) and the catalytic core domain (170-356), the later representing this entry. The catalytic core adopts an alpha3-beta3-alpha4 fold, where one side of the beta sheet is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The recombinases Cre from phage P1, XerD from Escherichia coli and Flp from yeast are members of the tyrosine recombinase family, and have a two-domain motif resembling that of lambda integrase, as well as sharing a conserved binding mechanism [[cite:PUB00014062]]. The structural fold of their catalytic core domains resemble that of Lambda integrase.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The catalytic core of the eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I shares significant structural similarity with the bacteriophage family of DNA integrases [[cite:PUB00005230]]. Topoisomerases I promote the relaxation of DNA superhelical tension by introducing a transient single-stranded break in duplex DNA and are vital for the processes of replication, transcription and recombination.&lt;/p&gt;

IPR017856	Integrase-like, N-terminal	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a structural domain with an alpha-helical, orthogonal bundle fold. Domains with this structure are found at the N-terminal (zinc-binding domain) of HIV integrase, and in the following hypothetical proteins: YebC from Escherichia coli, HP0162 from Helicobacter pylori (Campylobacter pylori) and aq1575 from Aquifex aeolicus [[cite:PUB00027019]].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Retroviral integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains: an N-terminal zinc binding domain, a central catalytic core and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00026646], [cite:PUB00024383]]. It is often found as part of the POL polyprotein.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR021109	Aspartic peptidase domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Aspartic peptidases, also known as aspartyl proteases ([intenz:3.4.23.-]), are widely distributed proteolytic enzymes [[cite:PUB00001330], [cite:PUB00000093], [cite:PUB00000349]] known to exist in vertebrates, fungi, plants, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, retroviruses and some plant viruses. All known aspartic peptidases are endopeptidases.  A water molecule, activated by two aspartic acid residues, acts as the nucleophile in catalysis.  Aspartic peptidases can be grouped into five clans, each of which shows a unique structural fold [[cite:PUB00000522]].\r\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peptidases in clan AA are either bilobed (family A1 or the pepsin family) or are a homodimer (all other families in the clan, including retropepsin from HIV-1/AIDS) [[cite:PUB00042504]].  Each lobe consists of a single domain with a closed beta-barrel and each lobe contributes one Asp to form the active site.  Most peptidases in the clan are inhibited by the naturally occurring small-molecule inhibitor pepstatin [[cite:PUB00076784]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AC contains the single family A8: the signal peptidase 2 family.  Members of the family are found in all bacteria.  Signal peptidase 2 processes the premurein precursor, removing the signal peptide.  The peptidase has four transmembrane domains and the active site is on the periplasmic side of the cell membrane.  Cleavage occurs on the amino side of a cysteine where the thiol group has been substituted by a diacylglyceryl group.  Site-directed mutagenesis has identified two essential aspartic acid residues which occur in the motifs GNXXDRX and FNXAD (where X is a hydrophobic residue) [[cite:PUB00076785]].  No tertiary structures have been solved for any member of the family, but because of the intramembrane location, the structure is assumed not to be pepsin-like.&lt;/li&gt; \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AD contains two families of transmembrane endopeptidases: A22 and A24.  These are also known as \"GXGD peptidases\" because of a common GXGD motif which includes one of the pair of catalytic aspartic acid residues.  Structures are known for members of both families and show a unique, common fold with up to nine transmembrane regions [[cite:PUB00066803]].  The active site aspartic acids are located within a large cavity in the membrane into which water can gain access [[cite:PUB00065205]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AE contains two families, A25 and A31.  Tertiary structures have been solved for members of both families and show a common fold consisting of an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich, in which the beta sheet is five stranded [[cite:PUB00011023], [cite:PUB00021296]].&lt;/li&gt;  \r\n&lt;li&gt;Clan AF contains the single family A26.  Members of the clan are membrane-proteins with a unique fold.  Homologues are known only from bacteria.  The structure of omptin (also known as OmpT) shows a cylindrical barrel containing ten beta strands inserted in the membrane with the active site residues on the outer surface [[cite:PUB00011707]].&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;There are two families of aspartic peptidases for which neither structure nor active site residues are known and these are not assigned to clans.   Family A5 includes thermopsin, an endopeptidase found only in thermophilic archaea.  Family A36 contains sporulation factor SpoIIGA, which is known to process and activate sigma factor E, one of the transcription factors that controls sporulation in bacteria [[cite:PUB00076786]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This domain superfamily is found in aspartic peptidases, including pepsin A and other peptidase A1 family members, the yeast DNA-damage inducible protein 1 (Ddi1) (MEROPS peptidase subfamily A28A), animal retroviral-like aspartic protease (SASPase; MEROPS peptidase subfamily A28B) and Caulobacter PerP peptidase (MEROPS peptidase family A32). The tertiary structure shows a retropepsin-like fold and the peptidase is active as a homodimer [[cite:PUB00041573]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR036162	Resolvase-like, N-terminal catalytic domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination plays an important role in DNA rearrangement in prokaryotic organisms. Two types of site-specific recombination are known to occur:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between inverted repeats resulting in the reversal of a DNA segment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recombination between repeat sequences on two DNA molecules resulting in their cointegration, or between repeats on one DNA molecule resulting in the excision of a DNA fragment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Site-specific recombination is characterised by a strand exchange mechanism that requires no DNA synthesis or high energy cofactor; the phosphodiester bond energy is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage and re-ligation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two unrelated families of recombinases are currently known [[cite:PUB00001148]]. The first, called the 'phage integrase' family, groups a number of bacterial phage and yeast plasmid enzymes. The second [[cite:PUB00003786]], called the 'resolvase' family, groups enzymes which share the following structural characteristics: an N-terminal catalytic and dimerization domain that contains a conserved serine residue involved in the transient covalent attachment to DNA, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain ([interpro:IPR006120]). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This N-terminal catalytic domains carries out site-specific recombination, process characterised by a strand exchange mechanism that requires no DNA synthesis or high energy cofactor since the phosphodiester bond energy is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage and re-ligation. It has an\nalpha/beta fold and consists of a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by\nthree alpha helices on one side and one helix on the other [[cite:PUB00019725]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR036333	RNA synthesis protein NSP10 superfamily, coronavirus	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; Non-structural protein NSP10 is involved in RNA synthesis. It is synthesised as part of a replicase polyprotein, whose cleavage generates many non-structural proteins [[cite:PUB00045296]]. NSP10 contains two zinc binding motifs and forms two anti-parallel helices which are stacked against an irregular beta sheet [[cite:PUB00040863]]. A cluster of basic residues on the protein surface suggests a nucleic acid-binding function. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The small NSP10 subunit is among the more conserved coronavirus proteins. It interacts with NSP14 and NSP16 and regulates their respective exonuclease (ExoN) and ribose-2'-O-MTase (2'-O-MTase) activities [[cite:PUB00094087]]. When binding to the N-terminal of NSP14, NSP10 allows the ExoN active site to adopt a stably closed conformation, allowing efficient hydrolysis of dsRNA [[cite:PUB00094105]].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One NSP10 residue, Tyr-96, is of particular interest. The aromatic nature of Tyr-96 plays a crucial role in the NSP10-NSP16 interaction and in the activation of the NSP16 2'-O-MTase activity as well as in the NSP10-NSP14 interaction. This residue is specific for SARS-CoV NSP10, and is a phenylalanine in other coronavirus homologues [[cite:PUB00094106]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR036397	Ribonuclease H superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The catalytic domain of several polynucleotidyl transferases share a similar structure, consisting of a 3-layer alpha/beta/alpha fold that contains mixed beta sheets, suggesting that they share a similar mechanism of catalysis. Polynucleotidyl transferases containing this domain include ribonuclease H class I (RNase HI) and class II (RNase HII), HIV RNase (reverse transcriptase domain), retroviral integrase (catalytic domain), Mu transposase (core domain), transposase inhibitor Tn5 (containing additional all-alpha subdomains), DnaQ-like 3'-5' exonucleases (exonuclease domains), RuvC resolvase, and mitochondrial resolvase ydc2 (catalytic domain) [[cite:PUB00016296], [cite:PUB00016297], [cite:PUB00016298]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR036515	Transposase IS200-like superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Transposases are needed for efficient transposition of the insertion sequence or transposon DNA. This entry represents a domain superfamily found in transposases for IS200 from Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00034636]]. The structure of this domain has a ferredoxin-like fold, which consists of an alpha-beta sandwich with antiparallel beta-sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR036862	Integrase, C-terminal domain superfamily, retroviral	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Integrase comprises three domains capable of folding independently and whose three-dimensional structures are known. However, the manner in which the N-terminal, catalytic core, and C-terminal domains interact in the holoenzyme remains obscure. Numerous studies indicate that the enzyme functions as a multimer, minimally a dimer. The integrase proteins from Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and Avian sarcoma virus (have been studied most carefully with respect to the structural basis of catalysis. Although the active site of avian virus integrase does not undergo significant conformational changes on binding the required metal cofactor, that of HIV-1 does. This active site-mediated conformational change  in HIV-1 reorganises the catalytic core and C-terminal domains and appears to promote an interaction that is favourable for catalysis [[cite:PUB00006506]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Retroviral integrase is synthesised as part of the POL polyprotein that contains; an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. The presence of retrovirus integrase-related gene sequences in eukaryotes is known. Bacterial transposases involved in the transposition of the insertion sequence also belong to this group. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;HIV-1 integrase catalyses the incorporation of virally derived DNA into the human genome. This unique step in the virus life cycle provides a variety of points for intervention and hence is an attractive target for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of AIDS [[cite:PUB00006492]]. Substrate recognition by the retroviral integrase enzyme is critical for retroviral integration. To catalyse this recombination event, integrase must recognise and act on two types of substrates, viral DNA and host DNA, yet the necessary interactions exhibit markedly different degrees of specificity [[cite:PUB00006507]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR036946	Gamma-retroviral matrix domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Retroviral matrix proteins (or major core proteins) are components of envelope-associated capsids, which line the inner surface of virus envelopes and are associated with viral membranes [[cite:PUB00014063]]. Matrix proteins are produced as part of Gag precursor polyproteins. During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved into major structural proteins by the viral protease, yielding the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and some smaller peptides. Gag-derived proteins govern the entire assembly and release of the virus particles, with matrix proteins playing key roles in Gag stability, capsid assembly, transport and budding. Although matrix proteins from different retroviruses appear to perform similar functions and can have similar structural folds which predominantly consist of four closely packed alpha-helices that are interconnected through loops, their primary sequences can be very different [[cite:PUB00055853]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry represents matrix proteins from gamma-retroviruses, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), Feline leukemia virus (FLV), and Feline sarcoma virus (FESV) [[cite:PUB00016326], [cite:PUB00016327]]. This entry also identifies matrix proteins from several eukaryotic endogenous retroviruses, which arise when one or more copies of the retroviral genome becomes integrated into the host genome [[cite:PUB00016320]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR036988	Picornavirus coat protein VP4 superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Picornaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses. Processing of the viral polyprotein by picornains 3C and 2A generates capsid proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, but VP0 undergoes an autolytic cleavage during virion assembly to generate capsid proteins VP2 and VP4 [[cite:PUB00054231]]. The autolytic cleavage was originally thought to be the action of a serine-type peptidase, but from analogy with the similar autoproteolytic cleavages that are known for capsid proteins from nodaviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N1), tetraviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N2), picobirnaviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N5) and reoviruses (MEROPS peptidase family N7), it is more likely that VP0 is an asparagine-type peptidase; autocatalytic cleavage being promoted by cyclization of a conserved asparagine. &lt;/p&gt;.
IPR038124	Beta-retroviral matrix superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;Retroviral matrix proteins (or major core proteins) are components of envelope-associated capsids, which line the inner surface of virus envelopes and are associated with viral membranes [[cite:PUB00014063]].

IPR038137	Excisionase-like superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The phage-encoded excisionase protein (Xis, [swissprot:P03699]) is involved in excisive recombination by regulating the assembly of the excisive intasome and by inhibiting viral integration. It adopts an unusual winged-helix structure in which two alpha helices are packed against two extended strands. Also present in the structure is a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, whose strands are connected by a four-residue wing. During interaction with DNA, helix alpha2 is thought to insert into the major groove, while the wing contacts the adjacent minor groove or phosphodiester backbone. The C-terminal region of Xis is involved in interaction with phage-encoded integrase (Int), and a putative C-terminal alpha helix may fold upon interaction with Int and/or DNA [[cite:PUB00016583]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR038148	Transposon Tn1545/Tn916, excisionase	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The phage-encoded excisionase protein Tn916-Xis adopts a winged-helix structure that consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet that packs against a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif and a third C-terminal alpha-helix. It is encoded for by Tn916, which also codes for the integrase Tn916-Int. The protein interacts with DNA by the insertion of helix alpha-2 into the major groove and the contact of the hairpin that connects strands beta-2 and beta-3 with the adjacent phosphodiester backbone and/or minor groove. Tn916-Xis stimulates phage excision and inhibits viral integration by stabilising distorted DNA structures [[cite:PUB00032591]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This superfamily includes excisionases from transposon Tn1545 [[cite:PUB00088203]] and Tn916.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR038166	Polyprotein cleavage domain PL2pro superfamily, coronavirus	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt; This superfamily represents a domain found in SARS and bat coronaviruses, which is about 70 amino acids in length. PL2pro is a domain of the non-structural protein NSP3, found associated with various other coronavirus proteins due to the polyprotein nature of most viral translation. The domain performs three of the cleavages required to separate the translated polyprotein into its distinct proteins [[cite:PUB00056024]]. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Structurally, this domain consists of 2 alpha helices and 7 beta strands arranged into an antiparallel beta sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR038345	Flavivirus envelope glycoprotein E, Stem/Anchor domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;  This entry describes the C-terminal domain, containing a stem region followed by two transmembrane anchor domains, of the envelope protein E. This protein is cleaved from the large flavivirus polyprotein, which yields three structural and seven nonstructural proteins [[cite:PUB00060493]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR038349	Surface antigen, GAG-binding domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents a domain found in the surface antigen protein from the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis and related species. This domain expresses three clusters of basic residues, largely lysines, that are critical for heparin-binding and cell adhesion during bacterium-host cell adhesion. This domain binds to the host cell surface glycosaminoglycans or GAGs of the Streptococcus [[cite:PUB00076057]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR038488	Integrase, DNA-binding domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This domain is found at the N terminus of a wide variety of phage integrase proteins. It is predicted to bind DNA. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR038634	Alphacoronavirus nsp1 domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the N-terminal region of the alphacoronovirus polyprotein, which contains non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). Nsp1 from alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) folds into a six-stranded beta-barrel fold with a long alpha helix on the rim of the barrel. This fold is shared with betacoronavirus SARS-CoV nsp1 [[cite:PUB00076175]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR038688	Flavivirus polyprotein propeptide superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The Flaviviruses are small enveloped animal viruses containing a single positive strand genomic RNA [[cite:PUB00000118]].  The genome encodes one large ORF, a polyprotein which undergos proteolytic cleavage of the precursor membrane protein (prM), turning inert virus into infectious particles. This entry consists of a propeptide region of approximately 90 amino acids in length [[cite:PUB00050900]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR042205	Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS2, C-terminal domain	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The viral genome is translated into a single polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. Generation of the mature non-structural proteins relies on the activity of viral proteases. Non-structural protein 2 (NS2) is an zinc-dependent autocatalytic endopeptidase which cleaves at the NS2/NS3 junction [[cite:PUB00000745], [cite:PUB00003531]]. The action of NS3 proteinase, which resides in the N-terminal one-third of the NS3 protein, then yields all remaining non-structural proteins.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;NS2 belongs to MEROPS peptidase family C18 (hepatitis C virus endopeptidase 2, clan CM). The fold consists of two subdomains connected by an extended linker: an N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal beta sheet. Peptidases are active as a homodimer and the two active sites are formed at the dimer interface by His and Glu from one monomer and Cys from the other. The dimer resembles a 'butterfly' with two-fold symmetry along the vertical axis. The N-terminal subdomain of one molecule interacts with the C-terminal subdomain of the other molecule and vice versa [[cite:PUB00041366]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This superfamily represents the C-terminal domain of hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS2.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR042209	Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS2, N-terminal domain	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The viral genome is translated into a single polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids.

The N-terminal subdomain of one molecule interacts with the C-terminal subdomain of the other molecule and vice versa [[cite:PUB00041366]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This superfamily represents the N-terminal domain of hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS2.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR042566	L1 transposable element, C-terminal domain	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This superfamily represents a conserved component in the protein ORF1 of the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposon. This domain is designated C-terminal and its sole function is to assist RNA binding to the central RRM domain [[cite:PUB00056309]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR042570	Replicase polyprotein, nucleic acid-binding domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This superfamily represents the nucleic acid binding domain (NAB/NAR), mainly found in Orf1a polyproteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [[cite:PUB00076540]]. This domain presents a group of residues that form a positively charged patch on the protein surface which give rise to the nucleic acid binding site [[cite:PUB00066079]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR043128	Reverse transcriptase/Diguanylate cyclase domain	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This superfamily comprises domains found in several proteins such as reverse transcriptase [[cite:PUB00093715],[cite:PUB00055246]], DNA polymerase IV and several nucleotide cyclases, such as the nucleotide-binding GGDEF domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The representative domains have DNA-directed DNA polymerase, RNA-directed RNA polymerase and diguanylate cyclase activities, and are involved in viral replication, signal transduction, nucleotide binding, and hydrolysis of cyclic diguanylate.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR043477	Peptidase C30, domain 3, coronavirus	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This group of cysteine peptidases correspond to MEROPS peptidase family C30 (clan PA(C)). These peptidases are related to serine endopeptidases of family S1 and are restricted to RNA viruses, where they are involved in  viral polyprotein processing during  replication [[cite:PUB00011621], [cite:PUB00011622], [cite:PUB00011623]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This Coronavirus (CoV) domain, peptidase C30, is also known as 3C-like proteinase (3CL-pro), or CoV main protease (M-pro) domain. CoV M-pro is a dimer where each subunit is composed of three domains I, II and III. Domains I and II consist of six-stranded antiparallel beta barrels and together resemble the architecture of chymotrypsin, and of picornaviruses 3C proteinases. The substrate-binding site is located in a cleft between these two domains. The catalytic site is situated at the centre of the cleft. A long loop connects domain II to the C-terminal domain (domain III). This latter domain, a globular cluster of five helices, has been implicated in the proteolytic activity of M-pro. In the active site of M-pro, Cys and His form a catalytic dyad. In contrast to serine proteinases and other cysteine proteinases, which have a catalytic triad, there is no third catalytic residue present [[cite:PUB00011621], [cite:PUB00022402], [cite:PUB00048878], [cite:PUB00051210]]. Many drugs have been developed to inhibit CoV M-pro [[cite:PUB00094068]]. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This superfamily represents CoV M-pro domain III, which is reported to be required for dimerisation [[cite:PUB00094067]]. Whereas the chymotrypsin-like fold formed by domains I and II is also present in MEROPS family S1 peptidases found in plants, animals, fungi, eubacteria, archaea and viruses, the C-terminal extra helical domain III is unique for the coronavirus 3CL proteases [[cite:PUB00004667], [cite:PUB00094067]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR043478	Non-structural protein NSP3, SUD-N (Mac2) domain superfamily, betacoronavirus	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This superfamily represents the N-terminal region of the SUD domain (SUD-N or Mac2) found in non-structural protein NSP3, the product of ORF1a in group 2 (beta) coronaviruses. It is found in human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein 1a and 1ab, and in related coronavirus polyproteins [[cite:PUB00056024]].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Non-structural protein Nsp3 contains at least seven different functional modules within its 1922-amino-acid polypeptide chain. One of these is the so-called SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-unique domain (SUD), a stretch of about 338 residues that is completely absent from any other coronavirus. The SUD domain may be responsible for the high pathogenicity of the SARS coronavirus, compared to other viruses of this family [[cite:PUB00048150], [cite:PUB00050012]]. Later, the NSP3 of MHV was shown by X-ray crystallography to contain a SUD-C-like fold, so it is no longer appropriate to call this domain \"SARS-unique\". This region has been renamed into \"Domain Preceding Ubl2 and PL2pro\" (DPUP) [[cite:PUB00094069]]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NSP3 has been shown to bind to viral RNA, nucleocapsid protein, as well as other viral proteins, and participates in polyprotein processing. It is a multifunctional protein comprising up to 16 different domains and regions [[cite:PUB00094069]]. SUD(core) exhibits a two-domain architecture. The N-terminal subdomain (SUD-N) and the C-terminal subdomain of SUDcore, also named middle SUD subdomain, or SUD-M [[cite:PUB00048150], [cite:PUB00050012]]. SUD-N has been shown to be dispensable for the SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex within the context of a SARS-CoV replicon [[cite:PUB00094069]]. &lt;/p&gt;
IPR043502	DNA/RNA polymerase superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This entry represents the DNA/RNA polymerase superfamily, which includes DNA polymerase I, reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase, lesion bypass DNA polymerase (Y-family), RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and dsRNA phage RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. These enzymes share a similar protein fold at their active site, which resembles the palm subdomain of the right-hand-shaped polymerases [[cite:PUB00094074]].&lt;/p&gt;
IPR044896	Hepatitis C virus core protein, chain A superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The HCV core protein is located at the N terminus of the polyprotein and is followed by the signal sequence located between the core protein and the E1 envelope glycoprotein. This signal sequence targets the nascent HCV polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), allowing the translocation of E1 to the ER lumen. Cleavage by a signal peptidase in the ER lumen releases the N-terminal end of E1, leaving the 191-amino acids (aa) core protein anchored by its C-terminal signal peptide [[cite:PUB00020019], [cite:PUB00053353]]. This 191aa polypeptide, also known as p23, is the immature form of the core protein; p23 is further processed by an intramembrane protease, the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), that removes the ER anchor , releasing  p21, the N-terminal 179aa mature form of the core protein  [[cite:PUB00020019]].  Core protein (p21) is responsible for packaging viral RNA to form a viral nucleocapsid, and it also promotes virion budding [[cite:PUB00053354]]. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Two domains have been identified in the mature form of the HCV core protein, based on predicted structural and functional characteristics [[cite:PUB00053355]]. Domain I, corresponding to the N-terminal  region of approximately 120 aa, is a highly basic domain that is probably involved in the recruitment of viral RNA during particle morphogenesis. Domain II, located between aa 120 and aa 175, is a hydrophobic region predicted to form one or two alpha-helices that are probably involved in the association of core with the ER membrane and lipid droplets. &lt;/p&gt; This superfamily represents the N-terminal chain A region of the Hepatitis C virus core protein.
IPR044936	Alphavirus nsP2 protease domain superfamily	interpro7_homologous_superfamily	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;The superfamily of alphaviruses includes 26 known members. They infect a variety of hosts including mosquitoes, birds, rodents and other mammals with worldwide distribution. Alphaviruses also pose a potential threat to human health in many areas. For example, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) causes encephalitis in humans as well as livestock in Central and South America, and some variants of Sinbis Virus (SIN) and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) have been found to cause fever and arthritis in humans [[cite:PUB00055516]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alphaviruses possess a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 kb. The genomic RNA of alphaviruses is translated into two polyproteins that, respectively, encode structural proteins and nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural proteins may be translated as one or two polyproteins, nsp123 or nsp1234, depending on the virus. These polyproteins are cleaved to generate nsp1, nsp2, nsp3 and nsp4 by a protease activity that resides within nsp2. The nsp2 protein of alphaviruses has multiple enzymatic activities. Its N-terminal domain has been shown to possess ATPase and GTPase activity, RNA helicase activity and RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity. The C-terminal nsp2pro domain of nsp2 is responsible for the regulation of 26S subgenome RNA synthesis, switching between negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis, targeting nsp2 for nuclear transport and proteolytic processing of the nonstructural polyprotein [[cite:PUB00055516], [cite:PUB00041527]]. The nsp2pro domain is a member of peptidase family C9 of clan CA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nsp2pro domain consists of two distinct subdomains. The nsp2pro N-terminal subdomain is largely alpha-helical and contains the catalytic dyad cysteine and histidine residues organised in a protein fold that differs significantly from any known cysteine protease or protein folds.\nThe nsp2pro C-terminal subdomain displays structural similarity to S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferases and provides essential elements that contribute to substrate recognition and may also regulate the structure of the substrate binding cleft [[cite:PUB00041527]].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This domain covers the entire nsp2pro domain.&lt;/p&gt;
IPR028229	Integrase repeat unit	interpro7_repeat	InterPro	&lt;p&gt;This repeat is found on integrase proteins in up to 15 copies. The function is not known.&lt;/p&gt;
